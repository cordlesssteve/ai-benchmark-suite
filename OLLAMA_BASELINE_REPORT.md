# Ollama Models Baseline Evaluation Report

**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Evaluation Framework:** AI Benchmark Suite - Direct Code Completion Test
**Total Models Tested:** 7

## Executive Summary

We conducted baseline evaluations on 7 local Ollama models using direct code completion tasks. The evaluation reveals significant challenges with current prompting strategies, as most models exhibit overly conversational behavior rather than direct code completion.

### Key Findings

1. **Best Performer:** `mistral:7b-instruct` - 20% success rate (1/5 problems)
2. **Performance Challenge:** Most models provide explanatory text instead of direct code
3. **Speed Variation:** Response times range from 0.48s to 31.54s per problem
4. **Model Size Impact:** Larger models (13b) show timeouts, smaller models are faster but less accurate

## Detailed Results

### Model Performance Ranking

| Rank | Model | Score | Success Rate | Avg Response Time | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | `mistral:7b-instruct` | 1/5 | 20.0% | 9.98s | Only model with any success |
| 2 | `phi3.5:latest` | 0/5 | 0.0% | 0.48s | Fastest response, but explanatory |
| 3 | `tinyllama:1.1b` | 0/5 | 0.0% | 0.71s | Small but conversational |
| 4 | `qwen2.5:0.5b` | 0/5 | 0.0% | 2.94s | Refuses to assist with code |
| 5 | `phi3:latest` | 0/5 | 0.0% | 3.11s | Provides explanations |
| 6 | `qwen2.5-coder:3b` | 0/5 | 0.0% | 3.39s | Code-focused but verbose |
| 7 | `codellama:13b-instruct` | 0/5 | 0.0% | 31.54s | Timeouts on all problems |

### Test Problems and Results

The evaluation consisted of 5 direct code completion tasks:

1. **Simple Addition**
   - **Prompt:** `def add(a, b):\n    return `
   - **Expected:** `a + b`
   - **Success Rate:** 0/7 models

2. **Even Number Check**
   - **Prompt:** `def is_even(n):\n    return n `
   - **Expected:** `% 2 == 0`
   - **Success Rate:** 0/7 models

3. **Maximum of Three**
   - **Prompt:** `def max_three(a, b, c):\n    return `
   - **Expected:** `max(`
   - **Success Rate:** 0/7 models

4. **String Reversal**
   - **Prompt:** `def reverse_string(s):\n    return s`
   - **Expected:** `[::-1]`
   - **Success Rate:** 0/7 models

5. **Fibonacci Recursion**
   - **Prompt:** `def fib(n):\n    if n <= 1: return n\n    return fib(n-1) + `
   - **Expected:** `fib(n-2)`
   - **Success Rate:** 1/7 models (Mistral only)

## Behavioral Analysis

### Common Response Patterns

1. **Conversational Responses** (Most Models)
   - "Here's the completed Python function..."
   - "To create a function that..."
   - "Certainly! Below is the complete..."

2. **Refusal Responses** (Qwen2.5:0.5b)
   - "I'm sorry, but I can't generate..."
   - "I'm sorry, but I can't assist..."

3. **Direct Code** (Rare - Only Mistral on 1 problem)
   - Successfully completed: `fib(n-2)`

### Performance Characteristics

#### Speed Tiers
- **Fast (< 1s):** phi3.5:latest (0.48s)
- **Medium (1-5s):** tinyllama, qwen models, phi3 (0.7-3.4s)
- **Slow (5-15s):** mistral:7b-instruct (9.98s)
- **Very Slow (>30s):** codellama:13b-instruct (31.54s, timeouts)

#### Model Size vs Performance
- **Smallest (0.5-1.1B):** Fast but poor accuracy
- **Medium (3-7B):** Moderate speed, variable accuracy
- **Large (13B):** Slow with timeouts

## Technical Insights

### Prompting Strategy Issues

The current direct prompting approach reveals fundamental challenges:

1. **Instruction Tuning Bias:** Models are trained to be helpful and explanatory
2. **Code Completion vs Chat:** Most models operate in chat mode rather than completion
3. **Context Understanding:** Models interpret incomplete code as requests for help

### Successful Patterns

Mistral's success on the fibonacci problem suggests:
- Recursive patterns may be better recognized
- Mathematical contexts might be clearer
- Partial function completion works better than empty returns

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Improve Prompting Strategy**
   ```
   Current: "def add(a, b):\n    return "
   Better: "# Complete this code directly, no explanation:\ndef add(a, b):\n    return "
   ```

2. **Focus on Mistral Model**
   - Best performing model for code completion
   - Investigate optimal prompting for this model
   - Consider this as primary baseline model

3. **Alternative Evaluation Approaches**
   - Try function-in-context prompting
   - Use few-shot examples
   - Test with more specific code completion instructions

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Model Selection for Production**
   - Mistral:7b-instruct shows most promise
   - Consider fine-tuning smaller models for speed
   - Evaluate trade-offs between speed and accuracy

2. **Benchmark Suite Integration**
   - Current unified runner may need Ollama-specific adaptations
   - Direct API calls work better than harness integration
   - Consider creating Ollama-optimized evaluation protocols

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - CodeLlama timeouts suggest resource constraints
   - Smaller models (phi3.5, tinyllama) offer speed advantages
   - Consider ensemble approaches combining speed and accuracy

## Baseline Metrics Established

### Reference Performance Numbers

These baselines can be used for comparison with future evaluations:

- **Best Code Completion Rate:** 20% (Mistral:7b-instruct)
- **Fastest Response Time:** 0.48s (phi3.5:latest)
- **Most Reliable Model:** mistral:7b-instruct (no timeouts)
- **Problematic Model:** codellama:13b-instruct (timeouts)

### Success Criteria for Future Evaluations

- **Minimum Viable:** >30% completion rate

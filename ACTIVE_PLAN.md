#### 2.2 Evaluation Testing
- [ ] **Quick Suite Testing**: Validate quick evaluation suite
  - BigCode tasks (humaneval)
  - LM-Eval tasks (hellaswag)
  - Cross-harness results comparison

- [ ] **Model Type Testing**: Test all model interface types
  - Local HuggingFace models
  - Ollama models (existing working)
  - API models (if keys available)

### Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Week 3-4)
**Goal:** Production readiness and initial enhancements

#### 3.1 Production Features
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and recovery
- [ ] **Logging Enhancement**: Comprehensive logging and debugging
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Efficient resource usage
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: YAML schema validation

#### 3.2 User Experience
- [ ] **CLI Enhancement**: Improved command-line interface
- [ ] **Progress Reporting**: Real-time evaluation progress
- [ ] **Results Visualization**: Basic results comparison tools

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Daily Tasks
1. **Morning**: Check CURRENT_STATUS.md for latest reality
2. **Development**: Focus on current phase objectives
3. **Testing**: Validate changes with actual evaluations
4. **Documentation**: Update status and plan as needed

### Weekly Reviews
- Update CURRENT_STATUS.md with completed items
- Adjust ACTIVE_PLAN.md based on progress and discoveries
- Log progress in `/docs/progress/YYYY-MM/`

## ðŸš§ Current Blockers & Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Harness Setup**: Need to validate BigCode and LM-Eval harness setup automation
- **Model Access**: May need API keys for full testing of commercial models
- **Test Environment**: Need clean environment for setup validation

### Decisions Needed
- **Results Storage**: Finalize results organization structure
- **Statistical Analysis**: Determine integration points with existing analysis code
- **Configuration**: Validate YAML schema and validation approach

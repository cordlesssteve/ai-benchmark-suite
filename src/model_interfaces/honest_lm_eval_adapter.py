HONEST LM-Eval Adapter - Prototype Implementation

⚠️  IMPORTANT: This is NOT a real LM-Eval harness integration!
⚠️  This is a simplified prototype that demonstrates language understanding evaluation.
⚠️  It uses direct Ollama calls with basic reasoning assessment.

The LM-Eval harness IS properly installed and could be integrated, but this
implementation provides a simplified evaluation for demonstration purposes.

TODO: Replace with actual LM-Eval harness integration for production use.

If no such pairs exist after checking all possible consecutive element combinations, then we'll conclude with a final result that returns False\u2014indicating there are no close enough neighbors in the list.\n\nThe provided test cases demonstrate how to use this function: when given two lists of numbers and respective thresholds where adjacent elements meet or exceed these values (in other words they aren\u2019t too far apart), it will return `True`, indicating that at least one pair is within our closeness criteria; otherwise, if all pairs are further than the threshold distance from each other in a list, then we'll get False.\n\nRemember to test your function with various inputs for robustness and correct behavior under different scenarios!",

          "generated_text": "To implement the `has_close_elements` function as described in Python using type hints from the typing module, you can follow this code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two elements closer to each other than a specified threshold.\n    \n    Argyments::\n        >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 0.3)\n        True\n        \n    Example:\n        >>> numbers = [1.0, 2.8, 3.0]\n        threshold = 0.5\n        result = has_close_elements(numbers, threshold)\n    \n    Returns::\n        bool indicating whether any two elements are within the given distance of each other or not.\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):\n            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:\n                return True\n    \n    # If no pairs are within the given distance of each other.\n    return False\n```\nThis function iterates through all unique combinations (without repetition) in `numbers` using two nested loops and checks if any pair's difference is less than the provided `threshold`. It returns True as soon as it finds such a case, ensuring optimal performance by not continuing unnecessary iterations. If no pairs are found within this distance after checking all combinations, then False will be returned indicating that there were no close elements in relation to each other according to our threshold criteria.\n\nThe provided docstrings and examples illustrate how the function can be used: it returns `False` when comparing `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0]` with a threshold of `0.5`, as none of these numbers are within that distance from each other; conversely, for inputs like in your second example where two elements (specifically the pair `(2.8, 2.0)`) fall below this specified difference (`0.3`), it returns True indicating there is at least one close element according to our threshold criteria.\n\nRemember that Python's built-in `abs()` function can be used here for calculating absolute differences between elements in the list without having to write out a separate calculation, and we use range(len(...)) instead of iterating directly over numbers which is more pythonic but would not work with negative indices. The nested loops are necessary because each element must potentially compare against every other unique pair within `numbers`.\n\nThis code should be efficient for reasonably sized lists as the time complexity here will generally scale quadratically, O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in your list\u2014this being a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency. For very large datasets or when performance becomes critical (e.g., with millions of numbers to compare against each other) you might want to consider more advanced algorithms that can reduce this complexity, such as sorting followed by binary search for pairwise comparisons within sorted lists which would bring the time complexity down to O(n log n). However, these approaches may require additional space or preprocessing steps.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting how Python\u2019s dynamic typing and built-in functions like `abs()` can simplify code without sacrificing readability\u2014a key aspect of writing maintainable software that others (and your future self) will understand easily when revisiting the source later on.",

Also note how we handle unexpected characters (anything besides `(` or `)`); if encountered while building up our current group string, they are ignored and continue to next character in iteration loop; however, encountering them outside such context results into an error.\n\nHere's the output of your example:\n```python\n>>> separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')\n['()', '(())', '(()())']\n```",

The result is rounded off (if desired) to one place for consistency in output format when dealing with floating-point numbers that may have more than two digits following the decimal point due to precision errors inherent in Python's representation of floats.\n\nNote: If you want an exact fractional part without rounding, simply return `decimal_fraction` as is (without using `.1`). However, keep in mind floating-point arithmetic can introduce small imprecisions; if absolute precision matters for your use case, consider representing the number internally with a rational type or fixed decimal point representation.\n\nHere's how you might write this without rounding:\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number):\n    integer_part = int(number)          # Extract the integer part of the number using floor division (//).\n    return number - integer_part       # Return just the fractional parts.\n    \n# Example usage without rounding:\nprint(truncate_number(3.5))  # Output should be '0.5' exactly, not rounded off here due to floating-point arithmetic precision issues in Python (which may vary slightly).\n```\nRemember that when dealing with floats and subtraction of nearly equal numbers (`float - int`), you might encounter small rounding errors because computers cannot represent all real numbers precisely as they are infinite. If exactness is crucial, consider using the `decimal` module for fixed-point arithmetic or rational number representation from Python's built-in fractions library:\n```python\nfrom decimal import Decimal\ndef truncate_number(number):\n    return (Decimal(str(number)) % 1).quantize(Decimal('0.1'))   # Using the 'decimal' module for fixed precision arithmetic and rounding to one place after decimals as needed:\n    \n# Example usage with Decimal type:\nprint(truncate_number(3.5) + \" (using decimal)\"  # Output should be exactly '0.5'.\n```",

Subtracting this from the original floating-point value yields only its fractional part:\n\nFor example:\n```python\nprint(truncate_number(3.5))  # Outputs approximately 0.5, depending on rounding precision used in 'round()'.\n```\nNote that if you want to control the number of decimal places returned (e.g., always return two decimals), replace `num_decimal_places` with an integer value:\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number, num_decimal_places=2):  # Default precision set at 2 if not specified otherwise.\n    intpart = int(number)                     # Convert to a whole number by removing the decimal part of `number`.\n    fracpart = round((number - intpart), num_decimal_places)   # Calculate and return only fractional portion with desired precision.\n    return fracpart\n```\nThis function will always give you exactly two decimals, even if the original number had more:\n\nFor example:\n```python\nprint(truncate_number(3.512))  # Outputs '0.51', regardless of how many decimal places were in `3.512`.",

It uses an auxiliary helper function called `count_depth`, which calculates the maximum depth (levels) for each individual group of parentheses within that main string using recursion and backtracking principles to count nestings levels accurately, even in deeply nested structures with multiple layers.\n\nThe output is a list where every element corresponds to the deepest level of nesting found inside its respective parenthesis grouping from left-to-right as they appear separated by spaces within `paren_string`. For your example input '(()()) ((())) () ((())()())', it correctly outputs `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n\nThe helper function works like this: It iterates through each character in the string. Whenever an open parenthesis is encountered (`(`), we increase our current depth counter by one and update `max_depth` if necessary (i.e., when it's greater than what was previously recorded). Conversely, upon encountering a closing parenthesis (`)`, decrement the count of nestings level as you go back out from within nested structures until all parentheses are closed or balanced correctly according to their depth levels in relation with each other.\n\nFinally, we iterate through these individual groups and apply our `count_depth` function on them separately before appending results into a final list which is returned by the main parsing method as output: The maximum nesting level for every group of parentheses within your input string has been calculated accurately with this approach.",

The corrected code now properly calculates and returns depths without these issues.\n\nThe test case provided in the question (`(()()) ((())) () ((())()())`) has actually a mistake: according to my logic, this input would yield `[2, 3, 1, 4]`, not `2` as mentioned initially because of an extra level inside one set `(())()`.

Then for each group, we iterate through its characters to find out how many levels deep it goes in terms of nested parentheses using a depth counter and keeping track of maximum nesting level encountered so far within that particular group (using `max_depth`). Finally, these max-levels are collected into the result list which is returned at the end.\n\nThe time complexity for this function would be O(n), where n represents total characters in all groups combined since we're iterating through each character of every paren string group once to find out its maximum nesting depth, and space complexity will also depend on input size as it creates a list `nesting_levels` with same length as the number of inputs.\n\nNote: This function assumes that all parentheses are properly balanced (i.e., for every opening parenthesis there is corresponding closing one). If this isn't guaranteed, additional error checking would be needed to handle such cases appropriately in a real-world scenario where input might not always follow expected format/rules.",

The examples are now formatted using doctests syntax (e.g., `>>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')`), which makes it easy for users of your code to verify if their input produces expected output when they run the tests in a Python interpreter with support for this feature, such as Jupyter Notebook or IPython console.\n\nTo use doctests and check that examples work correctly:\n1. Save the function into a file (e.g., `filter_by_substring.py`).\n2. Run these commands on your terminal/command prompt to execute tests in Python interpreter with support for this feature, such as Jupyter Notebook or IPython console (`!` prefix):\n```bash\n$ python -m doctest filter_by_substring.py\n```\nIf the examples are correct and pass all of them (i.e., they return expected output), you should see a success message indicating that tests passed successfully without any errors in your terminal/command prompt's console window or Jupyter Notebook cell outputs, respectively. If there is an error with one example not producing desired result when executed as shown above, then the corresponding line(s) of code within `filter_by_substring` function should be corrected accordingly to make it work correctly for that specific case (e.g., if 'cde' was expected in output but isn't present due to a mistake).\n\nNote: The provided examples are already correct, so no further changes needed here unless you want additional test cases or scenarios with different inputs and outputs as per your requirements/expectations for the function behavior under various conditions.",

The default value for an empty or null-list is handled by checking if the provided list (`numbers`) has any elements. If not, it immediately returns `(0, 1)` to represent both zero summation and one (multiplicative identity) as products of no numbers are conventionally considered equal to `1`.\n\nThe function iterates over each number in the input list using a for loop; during this iteration, it multiplies these values together into an accumulating product. The sum is calculated by Python's built-in `sum()` method which adds up all elements of any sequence (like our integer numbers). These two results are then returned as requested within their respective tuple structure `(total_sum, product)`.\n\nThe docstring provides a detailed explanation and example usage for the function. It also includes an assertion to test that it behaves correctly when given different inputs like empty lists or non-empty ones with positive integers only (as shown in your examples). The type hints clarify what types of arguments are expected (`List[int]`) as well as indicating the return value's structure and data types.\n\nThe code is written to be clear, efficient for its purpose\u2014calculating sum and product without additional libraries or complex operations beyond basic arithmetic loops (which Python can handle efficiently). It also includes a default case handling empty input lists which are common edge cases in many programming problems that require special treatment like this one does.",

Here's how it works:\n\n1. First, we check if the given `numbers` list is empty or not using an `if` statement. If it's empty, then there are no elements to calculate a rolling max from and so we return an empty result immediately with `[ ]`. \n2. We initialize two variables - one for keeping track of maximum number (`max_num`) encountered till now (initialized as the first element in list) and another variable `result` which will hold our final output, initially containing only this max value itself. This is because at each moment we have seen so far there's always a rolling max up to that point - it would be just like taking maximum of all elements till now (which here starts with the first element).\n3. Then for every number in `numbers` list starting from second one, if this current value (`num`) is greater than our currently tracked highest seen so far(`max_num`), we update `max_num`. We then append it to result as well because that'dictates new rolling max till now after seeing the next element.\n4. Finally when all elements have been processed, return this list of maximum values encountered at each point in time through out iteration over input sequence - which is our desired output for `rolling_max` function. \n\nYou can test it with:\n```python\nprint(rolling_max([1,2,3,2,3,4,2])) # Outputs [1,2,3,3,3,4,4] as expected\n```",

The rounding ensures that we get a consistent result even when dealing with edge cases like `3.4` or very close numbers where the exact decimal representation might not be immediately clear due to precision limitations of floating-point arithmetic in Python and other languages.\n\nPlease note, I've added an input validation step at the beginning which ensures that we only process a float as requested:\n```python\n    if not isinstance(number, float):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a floating-point number.\")\n```\nThis will throw an error for non-float inputs. Additionally, I've added handling of negative numbers by taking the absolute value before processing with `math.modf()`. The rounding step at the end ensures that we get consistent results across different systems and Python versions:\n```python\n    return round(decimals, number.__class__([0]).itemsize - 1) if len(_) > 2 else decimals\n```\nHere `number.itemsize` gives us information about the precision of our float (usually around .4999... for Python's default floating-point representation), and we subtract one to get a consistent number of decimal places, rounding as necessary due to potential differences in how many digits are used internally by different systems or versions.\n\nRemember that when dealing with floats representing irrational numbers (like \u03c0/2) where the exact fractional part is not finite and repeating decimals start after a certain point, this function will only give an approximation of what's left over beyond the integer portion due to Python\u2019s floating-point representation.\n\nIf you need more precision or have specific requirements for rounding behavior (like always returning two decimal places), further adjustments can be made accordingly by changing how we handle and return `decimals`.",

If it finds any two distinct elements whose absolute difference is less than the provided `threshold`, it immediately returns `True`. Otherwise, if no such pairs are found after checking all possible combinations, it will finally return `False`. The example usage demonstrates how this function can be used to check for close numbers in a list with respect to some threshold.\n\nHere's an explanation of the code:\n\n1. We iterate over each element (`i`) within our input array using Python\u2019s built-in range() generator, which gives us indices from 0 up until but not including `len(numbers)`. This way we can compare every number with all other numbers in a pairwise manner without repetition (e.g., comparing the first and second elements only once).\n2. For each element at index i (`i`), another loop iterates over subsequent indices starting from `(i + 1)` to avoid redundant comparisons, as we've already compared `numbers[0]` with all following numbers in previous iterations of this outermost for-loop (and so on) when considering the second number.\n3. Inside these loops, an absolute difference between two elements is calculated using Python\u2019s built-in abs() function and checked against our threshold value: if it's less than `threshold`, we found a pair that satisfies this condition - thus returning True from within nested loop structure immediately stops further execution of the program (due to return statement).\n4. If no such pairs are encountered after iterating through all possible combinations, then function returns False indicating there were not any two numbers closer together than our threshold in given list `numbers`. \n5. The provided examples demonstrate how this code works: for `[1.0,2.8,3.0]` and a threshold of `0.3`, the absolute differences between all pairs are greater or equal to that value (e.g., `|1 - 2.8| = 1.8` which is not less than our given threshold), thus returning False; for `[1.0,4.0,5.0]` and a `threshold=0.3`, the absolute difference between elements at indices `(0,2)` (`abs(1 - 5) = 4`) does meet this condition (lesser value than our given threshold), thus returning True as expected from function's specification/documentation comments above it in code block.\n6. The typing module is used to specify that the input `numbers` should be a list of floats, and output will always return boolean values (`True`, or equivalently non-zero). This helps with type checking when using this method as part of larger programs where correct data types are essential for proper functioning (especially in more complex codebases involving multiple functions/modules interactively working together), thus helping to prevent potential bugs and errors.\n7. The docstring at the beginning provides a clear explanation about what our `has_close_elements` method does, its inputs (`numbers: List[float]` list of numbers with float values; threshold as input parameter) along with expected output (a boolean value). It also includes examples for users to understand how they can use this function.\n8. The usage example at the end demonstrates a practical way in which one might call and test our `has_close_elements` method, using Python's built-in doctest module (`>>>`) as an inline testing tool within docstring comments for immediate feedback on whether or not it works correctly according to its specification. This is particularly useful when writing code that needs frequent debugging/testing during development phase - providing quick and easy way of validating expected outputs from given inputs, without needing separate test files etc., which can be time-consuming in larger projects with multiple functions interactively working together (like this one).\n9. The function is written to follow Python's idiomatic style: clear variable names (`i`, `j` for loop indices; absolute difference between elements), use of builtin abs() and range(), nested loops, immediate return upon finding a match - all these are common practices in the language that make code easier to read/understand by other developers (or even oneself after some time).\n10. Finally note: this function assumes input list `numbers` is not empty; if it could be possible for an empty or non-numeric value within given array,",

The `re.sub()` method is used to remove all spaces from the input string using regular expression `\\s+`. This ensures that we only deal with parentheses characters in our final result.\n2.

The `[^()]` part matches any character that is neither an opening nor closing parentheses; the `|( )?R)` means \"or a balanced groups of parenthesis\".\n3.

Finally we return the resulting matched items converted back to a List object using Python'dict comprehension: `{item for item in match_result}`.

The extracted substrings are then added into a list, which is returned as output by this function. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Firstly we remove all spaces in input string using regular expression with pattern `\\s+`, where `\\s` matches any whitespace character and `+` means one or more occurrences of the preceding element (i.e., space). The result is a cleaned up version without extra whitespaces, which makes it easier to extract parentheses groups correctly later on in this function using regular expressions.\n2. Then we define our regex pattern for matching balanced parenthesis: `r'\\(([^()]|\\([^()]*\\))*\\)'`. Here `\\(` and `\\)` match literal opening `(` and closing )`, respectively, while `[^()]` matches any character that is not a bracket (i.e., it can appear outside of parentheses), `|` means \"or\", `*` allows for zero or more occurrences before the next group inside brackets (`[...]*`), which in this case are balanced sets of nested parenthesis, and finally `\\)` matches literal closing )`.\n3. We use re's findall function to extract all non-overlapping substrings that match our pattern from input string into a list called `matches`, where each element is one group of properly closed parentheses (i.e., balanced). Note: this regex assumes there are no overlapped groups in the given paren_string, as per your problem statement's requirements; if they do exist and you want to handle them differently or extract all possible combinations including these ones too then a different approach would be needed with potentially more complex regular expressions.\n4.

It then uses this helper function in the main body where it splits input string into groups and calculates their respective deepest nestings using list comprehension, filtering out any empty strings/substrings with no nesting (which would return `None`).\n\nFinally, if there are multiple subgroups of nested parentheses present (`len(substrings) > 1`), it returns a sorted set to ensure unique values and maintain order. If only one subgroup is provided as input or all groups have the same deepest level of nesting (returned by `max()`), then just return that single value without sorting/filtering out duplicates, with an additional check for zero-depth subgroups (`if not len(substrings)`).\n\nThis implementation should work correctly and efficiently to solve your problem. Note: It assumes the input string is well formed (i.e., all opening parentheses have corresponding closing ones) as per usual convention in mathematics/computer science, but doesn't explicitly check for this condition within its body - you might want to add such a validation if necessary based on specific requirements or edge cases of your problem domain.",

          "generated_text": "The provided Python function `has_close_elements` is designed to check if there are any two numbers in a given list that are closer to each other than a specified threshold. Here's the step-by-step explanation of how the function works and its implementation details:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: \n   - `numbers`: A list containing floating-point numbers (the input data).\n   - `threshold`: A float representing the maximum allowed difference between any pair of elements for them to be considered \"close.\"\n   \n2. It returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether there are at least two close elements in accordance with the threshold provided:\n   - If such pairs exist, it should return `True`.\n   - Otherwise (no pair is closer than the given threshold), it will return `False`.\n   \n3. The function uses a nested loop to compare each element of the list against every other element within itself without repeating comparisons (`i < j` ensures this):\n   - For any two elements where their absolute difference divided by 2 (to account for rounding errors) is less than or equal to `threshold`, it means they are close enough, and thus returns immediately with a value of `True`.\n   \n4. If no such pairs exist after checking all possible combinations in the list:\n   - The function will return `False` indicating that there were not any two elements closer together than allowed by the threshold within this specific input data set.\n\nHere is an implementation based on your description, with some slight optimizations to reduce unnecessary comparisons (since comparing each element only once against all others after sorting can be more efficient):\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport math  # Needed for absolute value calculation if using Python versions <3.4 where abs() is not available in the standard library\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if there are any two numbers closer to each other than a given threshold within an input list of floats.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Sorting ensures that close elements will be adjacent in the sorted array, reducing comparisons needed.\n    numbers_sorted = sorted(numbers)  # This sorts 'numbers' and creates a new ordered copy for comparison without alteration to original data structure.\n        \n    previous_element = None\n    \n    for current_element in numbers_sorted:\n        if math.isclose(previous_element, float('-inf'), rel_tol=0) or not isinstance(current_element, (int, float)):  # Skip the first element as there's nothing to compare it with yet.\n            previous_element = current_element\n            continue\n        \n        if math.isclose((previous_element + threshold), current_element, rel_tol=0):\n            return True\n            \n    return False  # If we reach this point without finding close elements within the given tolerance (threshold) then no such pair exists in 'numbers'.\n    \n# Test cases:\nprint(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5))    # Expected output is False because all pairs are farther apart than the threshold of 0.5.\nprint(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3))   # Expected output is True because there's a pair (2.8 and 2.0) within the threshold of 0.3\n```\nThis implementation sorts `numbers` first to make it easier for adjacent elements with small differences between them to be identified quickly, reducing unnecessary comparisons when iterating through sorted data. The use of Python\u2019s built-in function math.isclose is essential here because floating point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors that are not significant enough in some contexts (like scientific computing) but must still consider for this threshold comparison task.\n\nRemember, the `math.isclose` method takes into account relative tolerance (`rel_tol`), which helps determine if two numbers could be considered equal when dealing with floating-point arithmetic where rounding errors are commonplace and expected to occur within a certain range of precision (defined by your threshold).",

          "generated_text": "The provided Python code defines a function named `has_close_elements` that takes two arguments:\n\n1. `numbers`: A list of floating-point numbers (the elements we want to check for closeness).\n2. `threshold`: A float value representing the maximum allowed difference between any two close elements in the given list.\n\nThe function's purpose is to determine whether there are at least two elements within this list whose absolute difference does not exceed the provided threshold, indicating they are \"close\" relative to each other according to some criteria defined by that threshold.

Iterate through each element in the list using a loop, comparing every pair of elements with one another to see if their difference is within the threshold range (less than or equal). This requires nested looping because we need two indices for comparison\u2014one index (`i`) iterates over all items while the other (`j`) goes from `i+1` onward.\n2. For each pair, calculate the absolute value of their differences and check if it's lesser than (or equal to) or greater than/equal to the threshold provided as input\u2014this is where we determine closeness based upon our criteria for comparison with respect to a given range around values in `numbers`.\n3. If at least one pair meets this condition, return True immediately because there are close elements within that list according to your definition of \"close.\" The loop will terminate after finding the first such instance due to Python's short-circuiting behavior (return statement).\n4. In case no pairs meet our closeness criteria throughout all iterations\u2014meaning every pair has a difference greater than `threshold`\u2014the function returns False, indicating that there are not any close elements in this list relative to the given threshold value.\n5. The provided docstrings include example usage of how one might call and interpret results from such functions: if no pairs within `[1.0, 2.8]` differ by more than `0.3`, then they're considered \"close,\" hence returning True; otherwise (e.g., in the first case where all numbers are distinct), it returns False because there is not a single pair that meets our closeness criterion within `[1.0, 2.8]` with respect to threshold `0.5`.\n6. The function uses Python's typing module for type annotations (`List[float]`) and includes doctests (examples embedded in the docstring) which serve as simple tests that can be run using a test runner like pytest or simply by executing interactive sessions where these examples are displayed directly from documentation strings when they contain `>>>`.\n\nHere's an implementation of this function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two elements closer to each other than the provided threshold.\n    \n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    \n    :param numbers: List of floating-point numbers to check for closeness within each other.\n    :type numbers: List[float]\n    :param threshold: The maximum allowed difference between two close elements in the list.\n    :type threshold: float\n    :return: True if there are at least one pair whose absolute value of their differences is less than or equal to `threshold`, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    for i, num1 in enumerate(numbers):\n        for j, num2 in enumerate(numbers[i+1:]):  # Start comparing from the next element onwards with each iteration's current number\n            if abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold:\n                return True\n                \n    return False\n```\nThis implementation follows your description and should work as intended.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of its functionality and implementation details:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: \n   - A `List[float]` named 'numbers', which represents an array or sequence containing floating-point numbers (decimals).\n   - Another float value called 'threshold' that defines the maximum allowed difference between any pair of elements for them to be considered close.\n\n2. The function returns a boolean (`bool`) indicating whether there are at least two pairs in the list whose absolute differences do not exceed this threshold (i.e., they are \"close\" according to our definition). If such pairs exist, it will return `True`; otherwise, if no pair of numbers is closer than the given threshold, it returns `False`.\n\n3. The function uses a nested loop structure where for each number in 'numbers', we compare its difference with every other number (excluding itself) to see whether any two are within our defined closeness criteria:\n   - We iterate over all indices of elements using the outer loop (`for i, num1 in enumerate(numbers)`). Here `i` is an index and will range from 0 up until but not including the length of 'numbers'. The variable `num1` represents each element at that particular position.\n   \n   - Inside this loop, we have another inner loop which iterates over all subsequent elements in the list (`for j, num2 in enumerate(numbers[i+1:], start=i+1)`). Here `j` is an index and will range from i + 1 up until but not including the end of 'numbers'. The variable `num2` represents each element at that particular position.\n   \n   - For every pair (`num1`, `num2`), we calculate their absolute difference using Python's built-in function abs(). If this calculated distance is less than or equal to our threshold, it means the two numbers are closer together than allowed by 'threshold', and thus return True immediately. This early exit makes sense because as soon as one pair of close elements has been found, there\u2019s no need for further checking\u2014the function can stop processing since we've already met its purpose: to find at least a single instance where two numbers are too \"close.\"\n   \n4. If the loops complete without finding any pairs that meet this criterion (i.e., all differences exceeded our threshold), then no close elements exist, and thus False is returned after exiting both loop structures indicating there were none within 'threshold'. \n\nHere's a possible implementation of `has_close_elements` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    for i, num1 in enumerate(numbers):\n        for j, num2 in enumerate(numbers[i+1:], start=i+1):\n            if abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold:  # Check the closeness of each pair.\n                return True                   # Return immediately when a close element is found.\n    return False                             # If no pairs are within 'threshold', then return False after checking all elements.\n```\nThis implementation follows exactly what was described in your provided function and should work as intended for the given examples:\n- `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)` will output `False` because no two numbers are closer than a threshold of 0.5 apart from each other (the maximum difference here is between any pair).\n  \n- Conversely, for the second example: `has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)`, it will return True because there are pairs like (2.8 and 2.0) whose difference is less than or equal to the threshold of 0.3; hence they're considered \"too close.\"\n  \nThis function assumes that all elements in 'numbers' list should be compared with each other, so it does not handle cases where there are fewer numbers (fewer comparisons would naturally mean no pairs could possibly meet our closeness criterion). It also doesn\u2019t account for the possibility of multiple instances meeting this condition; as soon as one pair is found that satisfies `abs(num1 - num2) <= threshold`, it stops checking and returns True. This behavior aligns with your provided docstring examples, which only demonstrate a single case where two numbers are too close to",

          "generated_text": "The provided Python function `has_close_elements` is designed to determine whether there are any two numbers in a given list that are closer to each other than a specified threshold. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of its functionality and implementation details:\n\n1. The function takes two parameters, which have type annotations indicating they should be lists or floats respectively:\n    - `numbers`: A list containing floating-point numbers (the input data).\n    - `threshold`: A float representing the maximum allowed difference between any pair of elements for them to not be considered \"close.\"\n\n2. The function returns a boolean value (`True`/`False`), indicating whether such close pairs exist within the provided threshold in the list:\n   - If there are no two numbers closer than `threshold`, it should return False, meaning that all number differences exceed this limit of closeness.\n   - Otherwise (if at least one pair is found to be sufficiently near each other), it returns True indicating such pairs exist within the threshold criteria.\n   \n3. The function includes a docstring with examples illustrating its expected behavior:\n    - Example 1 shows that when all numbers in `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` are at least `0.5` units apart from each other (the given threshold), there's no pair closer than the specified distance; hence it returns False.\n    - Example 2 demonstrates a case where within an array of numbers `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]`, two elements (specifically `2.8` and another number close to this value) are closer than the threshold (`0.3`), so it returns True indicating that there is at least one pair of numbers within a distance lesser than what's allowed by our criterion for closeness.\n    - These examples help clarify how you might expect `has_close_elements` function to behave when called with different inputs and thresholds.\n    \n4. The implementation should follow these steps:\n   - Iterate through each element in the list, comparing it against every other number within that same list using nested loops (an outer loop for one index of comparison and an inner loop starting from after this current position). This way we avoid redundant comparisons between elements already compared with another.\n   \n5. For efficiency reasons\u2014especially when dealing with large lists or small thresholds, which could lead to a significant number of iterations (quadratic time complexity)\u2014it's essential that the implementation is optimized:\n   - One way might be using sorting and then checking for consecutive elements within threshold distance in one pass. However, this approach would change from O(n^2) to approximately O(n log n), which could still not meet performance expectations if `threshold` tends towards zero or the list is very large with many close pairs spread out across it (in such cases a linear scan might be more appropriate).\n    - Another optimization can involve using data structures like balanced binary search trees, hash tables for quick lookups and insertions. However, this would require additional space complexity trade-offs as well as potentially complex code changes to maintain these internal representations during the iteration process over `numbers`. \n   - If we are only interested in finding any pair of close elements (not necessarily consecutive), a more efficient approach could be using two pointers or indices that scan through sorted numbers, which would lead us back into O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting but with potentially fewer iterations. This is because once the list gets sufficiently ordered by magnitude\u2014which we must do for this methodology\u2014we can skip elements and only compare adjacent ones if they are within threshold distance of each other afterward, which would be more efficient than comparing every pair directly in an unsorted array or a sorted one without taking advantage of consecutive checks.\n    - If the list is already ordered (or we sort it), then for any given element at index `i`, and assuming no elements are within threshold distance from each other on either side, there's only need to check if current number plus/minus some small margin around itself falls into range of another; this can reduce iterations significantly.\n    \nHere is a simple implementation without additional optimizations:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):\n            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) < threshold:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\nThis implementation directly follows the described logic and will work correctly. However, it's not optimized beyond avoiding redundant comparisons (which is already done by starting `",

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how we can understand and verify this behavior, followed by an implementation:\n\n1. **Understanding Function Purpose**: The function takes two arguments - `numbers`, which is expected to be a list containing float numbers; and `threshold`, representing some minimum distance between elements for them not to be considered \"close.\" It returns True if there are at least any pair of adjacent (consecutive) items in the given list whose absolute difference does not exceed this threshold. Otherwise, it will return False indicating that all pairs within a certain proximity have been found and no further checks need to occur since we're only interested in consecutive elements for simplicity here or because they are assumed close enough based on context (e.g., time series data where the order matters).\n\n2. **Reading Test Cases**: The provided docstring includes two test cases which help illustrate how this function should behave when given different inputs and thresholds, respectively:\n   - In the first case `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]` with a threshold of `0.5`, there are no pairs whose difference is less than or equal to that value; hence it returns False as expected because all consecutive elements differ by at least one unit (in this context).\n   - In the second case `[1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]` with a threshold of `0.3`, there is indeed such pair `(2.8, 3.0)` whose difference equals exactly to that value; therefore it returns True as expected because at least one consecutive element within the given proximity has been found (in this case between elements '2' and '3').\n   \nHere\u2019s how we can implement `has_close_elements` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Check if in given list of numbers, are any two adjacent elements closer to each other than the provided threshold.\n    \n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)\n    False\n    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0], 0.3)\n    True\n    \n    Args:\n        numbers (List[float]): List of float values to check for closeness between adjacent elements.\n        threshold (float): The minimum distance considered as \"close.\" If the difference is less than or equal, return true.\n        \n    Returns:\n        bool: True if there are two consecutive items within 'threshold' proximity; False otherwise.\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1): # Iterate through list up to the second-to-last element only, as we compare pairs of adjacent elements (i and i+1).\n        if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i + 1]) <= threshold:\n            return True   # If a pair is found within 'threshold', immediately exit function with true.\n    return False             # Return false only after checking all pairs without finding any close ones, which means no consecutive elements are closer than the given threshold.\n```\nThis implementation iterates through each element in `numbers` except for its last one (since we're comparing adjacent items), and checks if their absolute difference is less or equal to `threshold`. If such a pair of numbers exists within our list, it immediately returns True; otherwise after checking all possible pairs without finding any close ones, the function will return False.\n\nThis implementation assumes that only consecutive elements are being compared for closeness (i.e., no non-adjacent comparisons), which aligns with typical interpretations of proximity in a sequential dataset or when considering physical distances where order matters and there's an implicit assumption about adjacency within the data structure itself, such as time series points that are expected to be close together due to their temporal nature.",

The goal is to separate these grouped parenthetical expressions into individual strings within a list and return that list.

The goal is to separate these grouped parenthetical expressions into individual strings within a list and return that list. Here are the key points for understanding this task before implementing it:\n\n1. Input will be a single string with various balanced, non-nested groupings of parentheses (e.g., '( ) (( ))'). Spaces should not affect grouping or separation process as they're ignored in input and output strings within the list elements.\n2. Each parenthetical expression is considered separated if it forms a valid sequence with properly matched opening and closing brackets without any nesting inside another group (e.g., '( )'(())'). The function should not consider nested parentheses for separation, only distinct groups of balanced outermost pairs are needed in the output list.\n3. Spaces within these expressions will be ignored when separating but must remain present between separate parenthetical strings returned by this function (e.g., '( )' and '(()())').\n4. The order should reflect how they appear consecutively inside of parentheses, with each group being a distinct element in the list as shown above for your example input string: ['()', '(())', '(()())'].\n5. No external libraries or tools are required; only basic programming constructs and logic will be used to solve this problem efficiently within Python's standard capabilities (e.g., loops, conditionals).\n6. The function should handle edge cases gracefully\u2014for example, an empty input string might return a list with no elements (`[]`), while strings without parentheses would also result in `['']`.\n7. Type hints are provided to clarify the expected types for inputs and outputs: Python's built-in List type along with typing module annotations (from) should be used accordingly within your implementation, even though they aren\u2019t strictly necessary as long as you maintain clarity of code intentions in a dynamic language like Python where static analysis isn't enforced.\n8. The function is expected to perform well and efficiently for various inputs without unnecessary complexity or redundancy (e.g., avoiding deep recursion if possible).\n9. Comments should be added within the implementation explaining critical parts of your code, especially how you handle separating groups while ignoring spaces in both input processing and output generation\u2014this is crucial to understanding not just what but also why certain decisions were made during coding (e.g., using string methods like `strip()`).\n10. The function should be tested with the provided example, as well as additional test cases that cover various scenarios including edge conditions mentioned above: an empty input and a non-parentheses containing strings to ensure robustness of your implementation.

Groups should not contain nested parentheses within each other; they need to stand alone as separate entities in the list of strings returned by this function. In your provided test case `'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'`, there are three distinct groups: '()', '(())', and '(()())'.\n3. Spaces inside parentheses should be ignored, so they do not affect grouping or separation process (e.g., the input string `'a(b c)d'` would result in `['abcd']`).\n4. The function signature indicates that it returns a list of strings (`List[str]`).\n5. An example test case is provided to illustrate expected behavior: when given `\"( ) (( )) (( )( ))\"`, the output should be `[\"()\", \"(())\", \"(()())\"]`. Note there's an inconsistency in your original description and this function; it returns three groups instead of two, which might indicate a misunderstanding or typo.\n6.

It builds up strings within parentheses, ignoring internal whitespace as required by your specification while also ensuring that each group of parenthesis is properly balanced. When it encounters a closing parenthesis ')' and there's an associated opening one already being built (i.e., `current_group` isn\u2019t empty), the current complete expression within parentheses gets added to our list, resetting this temporary string builder for subsequent groups of nested expressions if necessary.\n\nPlease note that in your example test case provided (`'( ) (( )) (( )( ))'`), there's a discrepancy between what is expected and described: the function should return three separate strings (not two) as it identifies distinct balanced parentheses groups, which align with my implementation.\n\nIf you need further clarification or have additional requirements for this task, feel free to ask!",

The goal is to separate these grouped parenthetical expressions into individual strings within a list and return that list.

Input is a string with multiple groups of nested and unnested parenthetical expressions (e.g., '( ) (( ))').\n2. The function will process the input to identify separate, non-overlapping parentheses pairs that are not contained within each other's scope\u2014essentially extracting distinct groupings from one another while ignoring spaces in between characters of these groups and any extra whitespace present at the beginning or end of them (e.g., '( ) (( ))').\n3. The function will then return a list containing strings where every string represents an individual, non-nested parentheses grouping found within the input\u2014each group is balanced with matching opening and closing parenthesis pairs without nesting inside each other's scope: ['()', '(())']. Note that in this example provided by you ('((()))'), there are no separate groups as all of them form a single nested structure.\n4. The function should ignore any spaces within the input string, treating only parentheses and their contents for separation into distinct groupings (e.g., ignoring extra whitespace between '( )' in your example).\n5. In case there are no separate groups or all of them form a single nested structure with each other\u2014the function should return an empty list since it cannot extract any individual non-nested parentheses grouping from the input string under these conditions (e.g., for just one set '()'). \n6. The expected output is provided in your example, where we have three separate groups of balanced and unnested parenthesis: ['()', '(())']. Note that this specific case has been slightly altered from the original function description to match a scenario with distinct non-overlapping groupings (e.g., if input was ('((()))') instead, it would return an empty list as there are no separate groups).\n7. The implementation of such functionality will require parsing through characters in string and tracking open/close parentheses balance while separating them into individual strings for the final resultant list when a balanced group is found without nesting within another one (e.g., '( )' would be separated as ['()']).\n8. The function uses Python\u2019s typing module to specify that input should accept only string types, and output will also return List[str], which means it returns list of strings where each element is a non-nested parentheses grouping from the original parenthetical expressions in the provided input (e.g., ['()', '(())']).\n9. The function includes documentation as docstrings that explain its purpose, inputs and expected output for clarity to users or other developers who might use it later on. \n10. Finally, a test case is given within triple quotes `>>>` which can be used with Python's built-in testing framework (e.g., pytest) as an example of how the function should behave when provided specific input ('( ) (( ))'). The expected output here would match your description: ['()', '(())'].\n\nHere\u2019s a possible implementation for this task, assuming that we want to extract non-nested groups from parentheses in any given string (ignoring spaces):\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport re\n\ndef separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:\n    # Remove all whitespace characters except for the ones inside of parenthesis.\n    cleaned_input = ''.join(re.findall('\\(.*?\\)|\\S+', paren_string)) \n    \n    groups = re.split('(\\(.*?)') if not (paren_string == '') else [] # Split on non-nested parentheses, empty string case handled separately\n        \n    result = [group for group in filter(None, groups)]   # Filter out any None values that may occur due to consecutive spaces or no parens at all.\n    \n    return [''.join(result[i:j+1]) if i != j else '()' \n            for i, g in enumerate(groups) \n            for j in range(len(g)) if not (g[:j] == '' or len(set(g[:j])) > 2)] # Construct the groups by joining characters within each found non-nested parentheses sequence.

Separation of Integer Part: We need to extract just the whole part from our floating-point input without rounding it off; simply casting `number` as an integer will do that job for us in Python because integers have no concept of decimal places beyond zero digits after a period (if present). \n   \n3. Calculation and Return: Subtract this extracted integer portion directly from the original number to find out what's left, which should be our desired fractional part\u2014the decimals we want returned by `truncate_number`. This subtraction will give us exactly how much is beyond the whole numbers.\n   \n4. Function Definition: Write a function with an appropriate name and signature that takes in one argument (a positive floating-point number) and returns another float representing just its decimal part, as per our requirement above. \n\nHere's what this implementation would look like based on these steps:\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number):\n    # Input validation to ensure the input is a valid nonnegative floating-point number (and not an integer)\n    if not isinstance(number, float) or number <= 0.0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive noninteger floating point value.\")\n    \n    # Calculate and return just the decimal part of our input by subtracting its whole component from itself\n    decimals = number - int(number)\n    \n    return decimals  # This is what we want to output, which should be between 0 (inclusive) and 1.0 exclusive if `number` was positive noninteger floating point value as expected by the function's docstring description.\n```\n\nNow let\u2019s test this implementation:\n\n```python\nprint(truncate_number(3.5))    # Expected output is 0.5, which represents just the decimal part of our input number (the fractional component).\n```\n\nThis function should now correctly return only the non-integer portion for any positive floating point numbers greater than zero and lesser or equal to one when given as an argument\u2014exactly what was described in your task.",

          "generated_text": "The provided Python function `truncate_number` is designed to take a positive floating-point number as input and return its decimal part while disregarding the integer portion. Here's how we can step through understanding and implementing the function:\n\n1. Understand Function Purpose: The purpose of this function, based on the docstring provided, seems straightforward\u2014it should extract just the fractional (decimal) component from a given positive floating-point number without considering its integer part. For example, if we input `3.5`, it will return `.5`.\n\n2. Analyze Input and Output: The function takes one argument (`number`), which must be a float representing some value with both an integer portion (before the decimal point) and a fractional component afterward. It returns another floating-point number, specifically just that non-integer part of `number`. \n\n3. Plan Implementation Steps: To implement this function correctly in Python without using built-in functions like `.split()` or converting to string type (which could introduce additional complexity), we can use arithmetic operations\u2014specifically subtraction and division by the integer portion itself, which is what remains after removing its decimal part from `number`.\n    - Firstly, find out how many digits are in front of the decimal point. This will be equivalent to finding the floor value (the largest whole number less than or equal to our input). In Python 3, we can use integer division (`//`) for this purpose: `integer_part = int(number)`\n    - Then subtract that from your original floating-point number which gives us just its decimal part. For example with the value of `.5`, after subtraction it will be exactly zero (since 3 minus floor of 3 is indeed zero). However, for numbers like `4.7` or any nonzero positive float greater than one, we would get a result that's not necessarily equal to our input number but rather the difference between them:\n    - Finally divide by this integer part if it\u2019s more significant (greater) and lesser than 1; otherwise return zero because there is no decimal component. This step ensures you don't end up with a negative or an incorrect fractional value when dealing with numbers like `3` which have only one digit after the point but are whole integers themselves:\n    - The function should handle cases where input number might be exactly equal to its integer part (e.g., 5, resulting in decimal .0). In such scenarios, we can simply return zero as there's no fractional component present beyond what Python considers ''.1'' for whole numbers when printed out or converted into a string representation of the float number:\n    - We should also consider that if `number` is negative and has an integer part (e.g., `-3`), we want to return its absolute value as decimals are always positive, so our function would need some additional logic for this case too\u2014perhaps by taking a modulus of 1 after finding the floor:\n    - Here's how you might implement these steps in Python code with appropriate checks and conditions. Note that we don\u2019t want to use built-in functions like `split()` or convert numbers into strings, as per your request for an implementation without those methods:\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number):\n    if number < 0:\n        return abs((abs(int(number)) % (1.0 + float('inf'))) - int(number)):\n        \n    integer_part = int(number)\n    \n    decimal_fractional = round(float(str(number).split('.')[1]) if '.' in str(number) else 0, number != integer_part and abs(integer_part + (decimal_fractional or float('inf'))) > 1.0:\n        return decimal_fractional / max(abs(int(number)), int((float('.'.join([str(integer_part), str(round(decimal_fractional * abs(int(number)) % (1 + number))))] if '.' in str(number) else '')))\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # If there's no decimal part, the function should also handle this case:\n    integer_part = int(abs(integer_part))  \n        \n    fractional_decimal = round((float('inf') - number) / max(1, abs(number)), 0 if not (str(int(round(fractional_decimal))) == str(number).split('.')[1] else float('nan')):\n        return decimal_fractional or fractional_decimal\n        \n    # If the number is exactly an integer, we should handle this case",

Here's how we can break down the task step by step before implementing the code:\n\n1. Understand that any given float consists of two parts, an integer (whole) portion and a fractional (decimal) portion separated by a dot '.'. For example, in 3.57, '3' is the whole number part while '.57' represents its decimal component.\n2. The function should extract this non-integer or \"fraction\" segment from any input float without actually rounding it down to an integer (which would be truncation). Instead of removing digits after a certain point like standard floor division, we want the exact fractional part as is present in floating points representation.\n3. To achieve that mathematically: subtract the largest whole number less than or equal to our input from itself; this will give us just its integer portion (truncation). Then by simply taking away this value from original float, you're left with only decimal component which we want as output here. In Python terms it means `number - int(number)`.\n4. The function should return the result of that subtraction operation to get back just the fractional part (decimal) without any integer components attached. This is what will be returned by our implementation, and this value must always fall between 0 and less than 1 because it's a decimal portion only.\n5. The function should also include appropriate documentation that explains its purpose clearly along with an example of how to use the function (docstring).\n6. Finally we write Python code implementing these steps within our `truncate_number` definition, ensuring proper syntax and type annotations for clarity as provided in your original snippet (`: float`). \n7. We also include a test case at the end of documentation to demonstrate that it works correctly (using doctest). The example given is correct\u2014inputting '3' should return '.5', which represents half past three on an analog clock, or simply one-half as its decimal value without any integer part attached.\n8. We can now run this function with various inputs to ensure that it behaves correctly and returns the expected fractional parts of numbers across a range of cases (including edge scenarios). \n9. Lastly, we make sure our code is clean, readable, efficient for its purpose\u2014and as requested by including an example usage in docstring format which can be tested using Python's built-in doctest module to confirm the function works correctly with various inputs and outputs are within expected range (0 <= output < 1).\n\nHere\u2019s how we implement it:\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, return its decimal part.\n    \n    >>> truncate_number(3.5)\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculating the integer and fractional parts separately using floor division (// operator).\n    int_part = int(number)  # Whole or integral portion of number, removing decimal part entirely.\n    frac_part = number - int_part   # Decimal component remaining after subtracting whole numbers from original float value.\n    \n    return frac_part\n```\nThis code snippet performs the task as described and should work correctly for any positive floating-point input, returning just its decimal part without rounding down to an integer (truncation).

Recognize that to extract just the decimal component of any float value without changing it into a string type or rounding off (which would alter precision), we can subtract from this number all integers up until one less than itself, effectively removing them and leaving us with only the fractional part. This is because when you remove an integer portion by subtraction in Python using `number - int(number)`, it will not affect digits beyond its decimal point due to floating-point precision handling of numbers (up to a certain number of significant figures).\n   \n3. Implement this logic within the function: We can directly return `(number) % 1`, which is mathematically equivalent, as taking modulo by `1` will give us just the fractional part since it's essentially asking for what remains after dividing our float number into whole numbers and decimals (which are always less than one).\n   \nHere\u2019s a simple implementation of this function:\n\n```python\ndef truncate_number(number: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\" Given a positive floating point number, return the decimal part.\n    \n    >>> truncate0123456789(.5).result()  # Example test case (not in actual function code):\n    0.5\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(number, float) or number <= 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive floating-point number.\")\n        \n    return abs((number - int(number))) # This will give the decimal part of 'number' without changing its value.\n```\nNote that I added an input validation step to ensure only valid, nonnegative floats are processed by this function\u2014this is not present in your original code snippet but a good practice for robust functions:\n   \nHere\u2019s how you might test the implemented `truncate_number` with some examples and edge cases (including negative numbers which should raise an error):\n```python\nprint(truncate0123456789(.5))  # Expected output is just .5, as in your example.\n# Testing a positive number close to integer:\nassert truncate_number(3) == 0  \n# Edge case where the input float itself has no decimal part (an exact whole number):\nassert truncate_number(123456789.0) == 0   \ntry:\n    # This should raise a ValueError because of negative value or non-float type, which we've handled above with an exception raising mechanism in the code snippet provided here for clarity and robustness purposes (not present originally).\n    truncate_number(-1.5)  \nexcept ValueError as e:  # Catching expected exceptions to confirm they are raised correctly when invalid inputs occur.\n    print(e)                    \n```\nThis implementation should now accurately return the decimal part of a positive floating-point number, and it includes basic input validation for robustness against incorrect usage scenarios such as negative numbers or non-float types being passed in by mistake.",

This represents our starting point before any transactions occur.\n\n4. **Looping Through Operations**: The function iterates through each integer in the `operations` list, which corresponds to deposits (positive integers) and withdrawals (negative integers). For every transaction amount encountered within this loop (`for operation in operations:`):\n    - If it's a positive number (a deposit), we add that value to our current balance.\n    - Conversely, if the integer is negative (representing a withdrawal request which would reduce account balances below zero when not enough funds are available), then:\n        * We first check whether this operation alone will cause an overdraft (`if amount < 0 and abs(balance + amount) > balance`). Here, `abs` gives us the absolute value of a number (the withdrawal's negative sign is ignored). If adding that transaction to our current account would exceed what we currently have in the bank ($5 or more), it means this operation alone will cause an overdraft.\n        * In such cases (`if condition:` block within `for` loop): We return True, indicating at least one withdrawal attempt has caused a negative balance (overdrawn). No further operations are necessary to determine that the account went below zero because we've found our answer early on in this iteration of transactions.\n        * If not (`else`), then simply add it as usual: subtracting for withdrawals or adding when depositing, and update `balance` accordingly with each transaction amount processed within these nested conditions (the balance is updated outside the if-statement).\n    - After processing all operations in this loop\u2014if we've never returned True up to that point (`else:` block after outermost for loop) \u2014it means no single withdrawal has caused an overdraft, and thus: The function returns False. This indicates throughout these transactions (deposits +/-), the account balance remained non-negative at all times without going into debt or requiring a loan from outside sources to cover expenses beyond what was deposited in this period of time.\n    - Note that if there are no operations, which is not handled by default here and would return False (since we start with zero), the function will always exit after processing all given transactions without returning True unless an overdraft occurs within them\u2014which aligns well with typical banking logic where a non-negative balance at end of day implies sound financial management.\n    - The `return` statement outside both loops (`else:` block) is redundant here because the loop will exit once it finds that there's no need to return False; however, including this makes for robust code by handling unexpected cases (like an empty list).

It could be removed without changing logic since Python functions implicitly handle such scenarios.\n    - **Example Usage**: The docstrings provided at function definition and examples demonstrate how the `below_zero` function should behave when called with different lists of transactions, showing both a case where balance remains non-negative (`False`) after all operations (first example) as well as one that results in an overdraft situation leading to returning True.\n    - **Type Hinting**: The return type `bool` is explicitly stated at the function definition line for clarity, indicating what kind of value will be returned by this operation\u2014a simple true or false based on account balance status after all transactions are processed (True if negative; False otherwise). This helps with code readability and maintains a clear expectation from anyone reading your Python functions.\n    - **Commented Code**: The comments in the function provide additional context for each step, explaining what's happening",

          "generated_text": "The provided Python function `below_zero` is designed to simulate a series of bank account transactions (deposits and withdrawals) on an initial balance of zero. The goal is to determine if at any point during these operations the account balance falls below zero\u2014indicating that the account holder has overdrawn their account, which in most banks would result in fees or penalties.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. The function accepts one argument called `operations`, which is expected to be a list of integers where each integer represents either a deposit (positive number) into the account, or a withdrawal (negative number).\n2. It initializes an accumulator variable named `balance` with zero since that's our starting point for checking against overdraft situations throughout these transactions.\n3. The function then iterates through each operation in the provided list:\n   - For deposits, it adds their value to the current balance (`+=` operator).\n   - For withdrawals (negative numbers), if adding them would result in a negative account balance afterward, this indicates an overdraft situation and thus returns `True`. If not all operations lead us into that case, we continue processing.\n4. After going through each operation without triggering the condition for returning True\u2014meaning no transaction caused our simulated bank account to go below zero at any point during these transactions \u2014the function finally concludes by returning False indicating there was never an overdraft situation in this scenario of operations provided as input data.\n5. The examples given illustrate how you would call the `below_zero` function:\n   - In the first example, `[1, 2, 3]`, all transactions are deposits and thus keep our balance positive; hence it returns False indicating no overdraft occurred here either.\n   - For input like `[1, 2, -4, 5]`, after adding up `+1` (deposit), we have a new total of +3 (`balance += deposit`), then `-4` for withdrawal would leave us at negative one (-1). Here the balance falls below zero during processing and thus returns True.\n   \nHere's how you might implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Detect if account goes into overdraft at any point given a list of deposits and withdrawals. \n    \n        >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])\n        True\n        \n        Examples provided in the docstring illustrate expected behavior for various inputs:\n    \"\"\"\n    balance = 0\n    for operation in operations:\n        if not isinstance(operation, int):\n            raise ValueError(\"Each transaction must be an integer.\")\n            \n        # Perform deposit or withdrawal and check against overdraft condition.\n        new_balance = balance + operation\n        \n        if new_balance < 0:\n            return True   # Overdraw situation detected, returning immediately with a positive boolean value (True).\n    \n    return False      # No transactions resulted in an account below zero; hence we conclude by returning False.\n```\nThis implementation ensures that the function behaves as described and also includes basic input validation to ensure each transaction is indeed represented by integers within our operations list, which enhances robustness against erroneous inputs.",

Here's what you need to know about this task step by step:\n\n1. The input parameter, `operations`, expects a list where each element represents either a deposit (+ amount added to the balance) or withdrawal (- amount subtracted from it). For example `[50, -20, 30]` means you start with $50 in your account and then spend $20 (withdraw), followed by receiving an additional $30.\n   \n2. The function initializes a variable `balance` to zero since the banking scenario starts from having no money at all before any transactions occur. \n\n3. It iterates over each transaction in the list: for deposits, it adds them directly into your balance; and when encountering withdrawals (negative numbers), it subtracts these amounts instead of adding more debt to an already negative account\u2014which would be a real-world bank error scenario where you cannot spend money if there's none.\n   \n4. During each iteration, the function checks whether at any point your balance drops below zero after processing that transaction: \n   - If it does fall into overdraft (negative), then `True` is returned immediately because this means a negative account balance has occurred during transactions\u2014this represents an error state or undesirable situation.\n   \n5. The function returns `False` only if, by the end of all operations in your list: \n   - Your final banking scenario remains non-negative (balance is zero or positive). This means that despite deposits and withdrawals throughout these transactions, you never went into overdraft\u2014this represents a normal state where no negative balance has occurred.\n   \n6. The provided docstrings give examples of how the function should behave: \n   - In `below_zero([1,2,3])`, all operations are deposits; hence your account remains positive after each transaction and returns False (no overdraft).\n   - With transactions `[1,2,-4,5]`: you first gain $1 then an additional $2 making it a total of +$3. Then with the withdrawal operation (-$4), this would indeed drop below zero balance to $-1\u2014so here True is returned (overdraft occurred).\n   \nHere's how we can implement and understand that function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"You are given a list of deposit (+) or withdrawal (-) operations on an account starting with zero balance. \n     Detect if at any point the banking scenario falls into overdraft (balance goes negative).

The function iterates through each operation in the provided list sequentially while keeping track of an account balance starting at zero.\n3.

After each transaction's effect on the balance is calculated:\n    a. If at any point during these transactions our running total (balance) goes below zero, we immediately return `True`. This indicates that there was an overdraft situation where money went into negative in the banking scenario being simulated by this function.\n5. After all operations have been processed without causing balance to go under zero: The final step of our loop will be reached and then it returns `False`, indicating no transaction caused a deficit, meaning that at every point during these transactions, we never went below the account's starting value (zero).\n6.

The first list does not cause a negative balance at any point; the second one results in an overdraft after processing.\n7. Finally, there's also some Python type hinting present (`from typing import List`) indicating that `operations` should be understood as expected to receive and return lists of integers (and specifically here it is clarified with a list containing only integer elements). \n\nHere\u2019s the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:\n    balance = 0\n    \n    for operation in operations:\n        # Apply each transaction to our current account balance.\n        balance += operation\n        \n        if balance < 0:\n            return True   # Balance fell below zero, so we immediately stop and indicate this with a 'True'.\n            \n    return False      # No overdraft occurred; the final returned value is `False`.\n```\n\nThis code snippet should now correctly implement what was described in your function's docstring.

The MAD measures the average absolute deviation from the mean value within that dataset and provides an understanding of how spread out or dispersed the data points are around their central tendency, which in this case is specifically calculated using the arithmetic mean.\n\nHere's what each part does:\n\n1. `from typing import List`: This line imports Python\u2019s built-in list type hinting from its standard library to indicate that a function parameter should be expected as an array of numbers (floats). It helps with code readability and can also assist in static analysis tools for catching errors early on during development.\n\n2. The `mean_absolute_deviation` function takes one argument: \n   - `numbers`: A list containing floating-point values (`List[float]` as specified by the type hint). This is where you input your dataset to calculate MAD from it.\n   \n3. Inside this function, we first compute the mean (average) of all numbers in our provided data set:\n   - `mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)` \u2013 Here's how that works step by step for `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`:\n     a. Sum the values (`1 + 2 + 3 + 4`), which equals `10`.\n     b. Divide this sum (the total) by how many numbers there are in your list \u2013 here's four items so you divide by `4`, resulting in an average of `2.5`. This is the mean value for our dataset.\n   \n4. Next, we calculate each individual data point\u2019s absolute deviation from this computed mean:\n   - The expression `|x_i - x_mean|` calculates how far away (in a positive sense) every single number (`x_i`) in your list is from the average value `2.5`. For example, for our dataset `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`, these deviations would be `|1 - 2.5| = 1.5`, `|2 - 2.5| = 0.5`, and so on until we calculate the deviation for each number in our list from `2.5`.\n   \n5. We then average all of those absolute values to find out how spread apart they are, which gives us MAD:\n   - The sum of these deviations is `(1.5 + 0.5 + ...)`, and when we divide this total by the number of data points (which in our case would be `4`), it yields an average absolute deviation\u2014our Mean Absolute Deviation for `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`.\n   \n6. The function returns a single floating-point value representing this MAD:\n   - In the provided example with our dataset of four numbers where each number is equally spaced from one another and centered around `2.5`, we expect an average absolute deviation (MAD) to be exactly halfway between these values, which would indeed result in a mean absolute deviation (`1.0`) as shown by your function's output for this specific dataset when run with the given code snippet or manually calculated following our step-by0xed explanation above.\n   \n7.

This helps users understand the purpose and expected behavior when they call this function in their codebase or during debugging sessions where inline comments are not present for guidance purposes.\n   \nTo implement it as described:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:\n    # Calculate the arithmetic mean of all numbers in 'numbers' list\n    mean_value = sum(numbers) / len(numbers) if numbers else 0.0  \n    \n    # Compute absolute deviations from this computed average for each number and find their mean (MAD).\n    mad = sum([abs(x - mean_value) for x in numbers]) / len(numbers) if numbers else 0.0\n    \n    return mad\n```\nThis implementation follows the same logic as described, but with a more Pythonic way of calculating both parts: computing average and absolute deviations using list comprehension within one line each before averaging them to get",

The purpose of this function is to insert the delimeter between every two consecutive elements in the input list. Here's what happens step by step:\n\n1. We start with an empty resultant list since we haven\u2019t processed any numbers yet, especially when given an initially empty `numbers` list as shown in one example test case (`intersperse([], 4)`). The expected output here would be another empty list because there are no elements to interspace between.\n   \n2. If the input list is not empty (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), we iterate through each element of this `numbers` array while keeping track of its index (`i`). For every iteration except for when it's at an even position in a zero-indexed system:\n    - We append the current number to our result list. This means that numbers like '1', '2', and then again, '3' would be added sequentially into this new resulting array as they are encountered during iteration through `numbers`.\n    \n   For example with `[1, 2, 3]`, after processing the first element (which is at index zero), we will have a result list of just that number: [1]. When iterating to '2', which would be position one in our array and an odd-indexed item since Python uses zero indexing. We then add both numbers along with delimeter, resulting `[1, 4, 2]`.\n   \n3. After processing all elements of the input list (including adding a final element from `numbers` to result), we iterate through this new array and insert our delimiter between every two consecutive items in it: for example turning [1, 4, 2] into `[1, 4, 2, 4]`.\n    - Note that after the last number of input list is processed (which would be at an even index), we don't add a delimeter because there are no more consecutive elements following it. This means our final result will not have any trailing delimiter(s).\n    \nHere\u2019s how you might implement this function in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    if len(numbers) == 0:\n        return []\n        \n    result = [numbers.pop(0)] # Start with the first element of numbers list in new array\n    \n    for number in numbers[:-1]:  \n        result += [number, delimeter]     \n                            \n    if len(result) > 0:         \n        result[-2:] = []        \n              \n    return result\n```\nThis implementation starts with the first element of `numbers` list and then iterates through all but last elements. It adds each number along with delimeter to a new array, which is returned at the end after removing any trailing delimiter(s). This code should behave as described in your examples: for an empty input it returns another empty list; when given `[1, 2, 3]` and `4` as inputs, it would return exactly `[1, 4, 2, 4]`.\n\nRemember that this function modifies the original array (`numbers`) by popping elements from its start. If you want to keep your input list unchanged for other purposes in a program where multiple functions are called on `numbers`, consider creating copies of it before processing with intersperse or using different methods (like iterating through indices) that don't alter the original data structure directly during iteration and manipulation, as shown above.",

          "generated_text": "The `intersperse` function is designed to take a list of integers (`numbers`) and an integer delimiter value (`delimeter`). Its purpose is to insert the given delimeter between every two consecutive elements in the input list. Here's what happens step by step when this function executes:\n\n1. The function accepts `numbers`, which should be a List[int], meaning it expects a Python list of integers as its first argument, and an integer value for `delimeter`.\n2. It initializes two empty lists inside the function body called 'result' to store interspersed elements along with delimeters between them: result = [].\n3. The function then iterates over each element in the input list (`numbers`) using a loop, except possibly for the last item (since we don\u2019t want an extra delimiter at the end). For every index `i` from 0 to one less than the length of numbers minus two:\n    - It appends the current number from 'numbers' into our result list. This is because each element in input should be part of output, with delimeters between them (except for consecutive elements at indices i and i+1).\n4. After iterating through all items except possibly one last item:\n    - It appends the `delimeter` to 'result' so that there\u2019s a space after each number in our original list of numbers, with exceptions being only between pairs (i.e., for every two consecutive elements from input). This is done using result += [delimeter].\n5. Finally, it returns this new interspersed `result` List[int] containing the delimeters inserted as specified by function requirements and examples provided in docstrings: [] or something like `[1, 4, 2, 4, 3]` for input lists of length two with a delimiter value.\n6. The doctests (examples) at the end show how to use this `intersperse` method by calling it and passing different inputs along with expected outputs: an empty list or `[1, 2, 3]` interspersed with delimeters of '4'. These examples help verify that our function is working as intended.\n7. To implement the above logic in Python code here's how you could write it out explicitly without using built-in functions:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    result = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the output.\n    \n    for i in range(len(numbers)-1):  # Loop through all elements except possibly one last item of input numbers.\n        result.append(numbers[i])   # Add current number from 'numbers' into our new interspersed List.\n        \n        if (i < len(numbers) - 2):          # Check that we are not at the end, to avoid adding an extra delimiter after last element of input list.\n            result.append(delimeter)       # Add delimeters between consecutive elements in 'result'.\n    \n    return result                         # Return final interspersed List[int].\n```\nThis code should now match the behavior described by your function's docstring and examples, inserting a `delimeter` after every two numbers from an input list of integers.",

Accepting Input Parameters: \n   - `numbers`: A List[int] representing a sequence of integers where we want to add separators. For example, `[1,2,3]`.\n   - `delimeter`: An integer value that will be inserted between each pair of consecutive elements in the list (e.g., if delimeter is 4, it should appear as: [1,4,2,4,3]).\n   \n2. Function Logic and Implementation Steps:\n   - Firstly check for an empty input `numbers` list; return immediately with an empty List[int] since there's nothing to interspace in this case (e.g., []).\n   - Initialize a new resultant list, which will hold the final output after inserting delimeters between elements of numbers. Let\u2019s call it 'result'.\n   \n3. Iterate through each element `num` and its corresponding index (`i`) within input List[int] using loops or comprehension:\n   - For every iteration (except for when we're at the last item), add both current number from numbers list, followed by delimeter to 'result'.

If the provided `numbers` list is empty, it returns immediately with an empty list because there are no numbers or pairs for interspersing a delimiter into. This case has already been handled as shown in your docstring examples and tests (e.g., `[], 4` should return `[]`).\n2. If the provided input does not contain any elements, it would also result in an empty list since there are no pairs to insert delimeters between; however, this case is already covered by step one with its corresponding test example (`[1, 2, 3]`).\n3. The function iterates through each element of the input `numbers` except for the last item (since we're inserting a delimiter after every two elements), and it appends both that number as well as the delimeter to an output list called 'result'. This way, between any pair in the original numbers array will be inserted one instance of our given integer.\n4. After iterating through all items except for the last element (which doesn't need a following delimiter), it appends just that final number without adding another delimeter afterward because there is no subsequent item to follow with, as per Python list indexing convention where `numbers[-1]` refers only to the very last value.\n5.

The goal of the function is to insert the delimeter between every two consecutive elements in the input list. Here's how you can understand its behavior step by step:\n\n1. Accepting Input List `numbers`: This represents any sequence of numbers that we want to modify with our interspersed delimiter value. For example, if given `[2, 3]`, it means these two consecutive integers are the elements in your input list for which you'd like a delimeter inserted between them.\n   \n2. Delimiter Value `delimeter`: This is an integer that will be placed between each pair of numbers from our initial sequence to create a new modified version with added spacing or separation, so if we choose 5 as the delimiter and start with `[1, 4]`, after processing it would become `[1, 5, 4]`.\n   \n3. Function Output: The function will return this newly created list where each pair of consecutive numbers from `numbers` is separated by a single instance of our chosen delimeter value (`delimeter`). If the input list was empty or had only one element (e.g., `[1]`), there would be no pairs to separate, and thus an empty resultant array should also return as output because nothing needs separating in this case.\n   \n4. Edge Cases: The function includes docstrings with examples that demonstrate how it handles edge cases such as when the input list is empty (`[]`) or contains only one element (e.g., `[1]`). In these scenarios, since there are no pairs of numbers to separate by a delimiter, an appropriately simple output like `[]` for an empty case should be returned because nothing needs separating in this scenario either way.\n   \n5. Implementation: The function implementation will involve iterating over the input list and inserting our delimeter between each pair of consecutive elements while constructing or modifying a new array to hold these results, which we'll return at the end. We need special handling for when there are no pairs (empty lists) as mentioned in step 4 above because simply adding delimiter(s) won\u2019t make sense here and could lead to incorrect behavior like inserting multiple delimeters or creating an unexpected resultant list structure with extra elements that don't belong together, which would not align with the function specification.\n   \nHere is a possible implementation of this `intersperse` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers`. Returns an empty array if the original one is either empty or has only one element. \n    \n    >>> intersperse([1,2,3],4) # Inserts delimeters after each pair: [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers or len(numbers) == 1:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(numbers)-1): # Iterate until the second-to-last element (since we're looking at pairs of elements).\n        result.append(numbers[i])                   # Add current number to our new list without delimeter.\n        if len(result) > 0 and i < len(numbers)-2:    # Check that there are enough numbers left for another pair, but not the last element itself (which doesn't have a following consecutive one).\n            result.append(delimeter)                   # Add delimeter to our new list after current number if possible.\n    \n    return result  # Return final interspersed array of integers with delimiter values between each pair in original input sequence, or empty array for edge cases as specified above.\n```\nThis implementation considers the special case where there are no pairs (empty lists) and returns an appropriate response (`[]`). It also avoids unnecessary operations when dealing with single-element inputs by immediately returning `[]`. The loop iterates through each element of our input list except for its last, appending it to a new resultant array. After adding the current number without delimeter (to maintain pairs), if there are still elements left in the original sequence and we're not at or past the final pairwise position (`i < len(numbers)-2`), then an additional delimiter is inserted into our results list, ensuring that each consecutive element from `numbers` has a corresponding interspersed delimeter.\n   \nThis implementation should meet all requirements specified in your function",

The outermost parenthesis is considered as a \"level 0\" of deepest nested structure, each subsequent inner pair increases the current counting by one unit indicating deeper levels within those groups.

          "generated_text": "The given Python function `parse_nested_parens` is designed to analyze a string that contains multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal is to determine the deepest level of nesting for each group within these parentheses and return them as a list of integers representing those levels, in order from left to right (or top to bottom) according to their position in the input string.\n\nHere's how we can understand this function step by step:\n\n1. The `parse_nested_parens` takes one argument called `paren_string`, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of parentheses groups (e.g., '(()()) ((())) ()').\n   \n2. It returns a list where each element corresponds to the deepest nesting level for that group in order from leftmost input string position: e.g., `['(', ')', '', '', '')'` would yield `[1, 0, 0, 3]`. The function assumes well-formed parentheses with no errors like unbalanced or mismatched pairs; otherwise it may not work correctly and could raise exceptions during execution (though this is beyond the scope of what's asked here).\n   \n3. To implement `parse_nested_parens`, we need to:\n   - Split input string into separate groups based on spaces, which can be done using `.split()` method in Python.\n   - For each group separately analyze its nesting depth by counting the number of opening and closing parentheses recursively or iteratively until a non-parentheses character is found (or we reach an empty substring). The maximum count for that particular string will represent the deepest level within it, which can be stored in some temporary variable.\n   - Collect these counts into one list to return as output of this function.\n   \nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport re\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    \n    def find_depth(group):\n        depth = 0\n        \n        for char in group:\n            if char == '(':\n                depth += 1\n            elif char == ')':\n                depth -= 1\n                \n            # Ensure that we only count when there's an actual opening parenthesis.\n            if not (char == '(' or depth < 0):  \n                break\n        \n        return max(depth, abs(depth))   \n    \n    groups = re.findall('\\(.*?\\)', paren_string) # Using regex to find all parenthesized substrings ignoring spaces within them\n                     \n    if not groups:  # If there are no parentheses in the string (empty input), return an empty list or a default value, for example [-1]\n        return []  \n    \n    depths = [find_depth(group) + group.count(' ') // 2 for group in groups]     \n                      \n    # Handling cases where there are trailing spaces after the last closing parenthesis of a substring (if any). These should not contribute to nesting level count, so we remove them from depths list:    \n    while '' in depths and len(depths) > 1:  \n        del depths[-2:] # Remove two elements at once because the last element is always an empty string due to trailing spaces.\n        \n    return depths\n```\nThis implementation should work for well-formed input strings with balanced parentheses, as requested in your example and docstring comments. It uses regular expressions (`re` module) to extract parenthesized substrings from `paren_string`, then calculates the nesting level of each substring using a helper function called find_depth().\n\nPlease note that this implementation assumes well-formed input strings with balanced parentheses, as mentioned in your docstring comments. If you want it robust against unbalanced or mismatched pairs (which could cause exceptions), additional error checking and handling would be required\u2014this is beyond the scope of what's asked here though.\n\nAlso note that this implementation uses a space-based approach to count nesting levels, which may not always align with your original interpretation if you were considering nested parentheses as \"layers\" or depth (like in real 3D structures). If so, we would need additional information about how these spaces are treated and possibly use different methods.\n\nLastly, please remember that this is a simple implementation without extensive testing for corner cases which may be necessary depending on your specific requirements\u2014always good practice when implementing functions!",

Initialize an empty list to store depth levels found in `paren_string`.\n2. Iterate over each character of the string, keeping track of a counter that represents current nesting level (depth). The initial value is 0 since we start at no nested parentheses yet encountered.\n3. Whenever you encounter an opening parenthesis '(', increment your depth by one as it indicates entering into another layer/level in our parsing context.\n4. Upon finding a closing parenthesis ')', decrement the current nesting level, indicating exit from that particular deeper scope of parentheses. If this results to zero or negative (meaning we've exited all nested scopes), reset depth back at 0 as it indicates starting over with freshly opened group(s).\n5. Whenever you encounter a space character between groups which does not affect the nesting level, simply ignore and continue parsing without alteration of your current counter (depth) value; this is because spaces are irrelevant to our counting logic for nested levels in parentheses.\n6. At each increment or decrement operation on depth during iteration, store that particular moment's maximum encountered depth into a list if it exceeded the previously recorded max at any point before encountering an opening parenthesis of deeper scope (i.e., when current nesting level is greater than what we have stored).\n7. After iterating through all characters in `paren_string`, return this accumulated maximum depths as a list, which represents the deepest levels encountered for each group within parentheses separated by spaces or other irrelevant delimiters (if any were present) throughout entire input string parsing process.\n8. The function should then be tested with various inputs to ensure correctness and robust handling of edge cases like empty strings, single-level nesting only scenarios etc., as shown in the docstring example provided for testing purposes (`parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')`).\n\nHere's an implementation following these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport re  # To handle splitting of input string into groups if necessary.\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    depth = [0] * len(re.findall('(\\(.*?\\))', paren_string)) + ['']  \n                 # Split the parenthesis string into groups using regex, and add an empty element for easier handling of spaces/delimiters between them later on in our loop logic:\n    max_depths = []  # To store maximum depth found within each group.\n    \n    current_group_index = -1  \n                        \n    def update(current_level):\n        nonlocal current_group_index, max_depths\n        if not (0 <= current_group_index < len(max_depths)):  # If we're outside of any group:\n            return False\n            \n        depth[current_group_index] = min(len(depth), current_level)  \n                        \n        max_depths.append(min(len(depth)-1, len(max_depths)))  # Append the maximum level found so far within this group:\n    \n    for char in paren_string:\n        if char == '(' and current_group_index < 0 or depth[current_group_index] > max_level + 1:  \n            update(len([depth[-2]])) # When entering a new deeper scope, we reset the previous group's maximum level to its last known value.

Here's the step-by-step understanding and implementation plan for the function:\n\n1. Understand Function Purpose: The purpose here is straightforward \u2013 it takes two arguments, one being a list (`strings`) containing multiple strings, while the other argument specifies which character sequence (substring) to look for within these input strings. It returns a new list with only those elements from `strings` that contain this specified substring at least once in their content.\n\n2. Analyze Input Parameters: The function takes two parameters \u2013 \n   - A List of Strings (`strings`) where we want to perform the filtering operation on each element within it, and\n   - Substring (a string) which is what you're searching for in every item from `strings`.\n   \n3. Define Function Logic: The function will iterate over all strings provided as input while checking if they contain our specified substring using Python\u2019s built-in method `.contains()`. If a match occurs, the corresponding element gets added to an output list which is initialized beforehand within this loop (or outside of it).\n   \n4. Implement Function: Here's how you can implement `filter_by_substring` function in code with appropriate comments for clarity and understanding \u2013 \n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring.\n    \n    Args:\n        strings (List[str]): A list containing multiple string elements to be filtered based on the presence of a specific character sequence within them.\n        substring (str): The targeted subsequence whose occurrence in each element must exist at least once for it to pass through filtering criteria and get included into output resultant array.\n        \n    Returns:\n        List[str]: A new list containing only those elements from `strings` that contain the specified 'substring'.

Test the Function with Examples (as provided): The function includes a docstring that contains examples of how to use this `filter_by_substring` method, which can be used for testing purposes:\n   - When an empty list is passed and we're looking for 'a', it should return another empty list as there are no strings in the input. \n   \n   ```python\n       >>> filter_by_substring([], 'a')\n           []\n       \n       # The expected output here would be ['abc', 'bacd'] because both these elements contain at least one occurrence of \"a\".\n       >>> filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde'], 'a') \n          ['abc', 'bacd']  \n    ```\n6.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown and implementation details for better understanding:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments, both are lists but with different types in this case: \n   - `strings`: A list containing multiple strings (of type List[str]). This is where we input our collection of string elements to be filtered.\n   - `substring`: An individual single-string element that represents the substring which will serve as a filter criterion for selecting items from the provided 'strings' list (type: str).\n   \n2. The function returns another List[str], containing only those strings found within the input 'strings' list, where each string includes at least one occurrence of `substring`. This output is essentially our filtered result based on whether or not a given substring exists in every element from the original collection provided as an argument to this filter operation.\n   \n3. The function uses Python\u2019s built-in List comprehension feature combined with 'if' conditionals for filtering: `[string for string in strings if substring in string]`. This line of code iterates over each `string` within our input list and checks whether the specified `substring` is present using an inline conditional expression.\n   \n4. Two examples are provided as docstrings to illustrate how this function operates when given specific inputs:\n   - The first example shows that if we pass in an empty List[str] (`[]`) with 'a' as our substring, the result will also be an empty list `[]` since there is no string within it containing any character. This demonstrates a case where filtering results in zero matches found and thus returns nothing (an empty list).\n   - The second example shows that when we pass `[\u2018abc\u2019,\u2019bacd\u2019,'cde','array']`, with 'a' as our substring, the function will return `['abc', 'bacd', 'array']`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown and implementation details for better understanding:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments, both are lists but with different types within them: \n   - `strings`: A list containing multiple elements where all items should be strings (or at least convertible to a string). In this context, it's the input data that we want to filter through our criteria of substring presence.\n   - `substring`: The specific sequence of characters for which you are searching within each element in your main 'strings' list. It is expected as an individual string argument (single-element lists should be avoided).\n   \n2. This function returns a new list containing only the elements from the input that include at least one occurrence of `substring`. If no such strings exist, it will return an empty list (`[]`). \n\n3. The provided docstrings give examples to illustrate how this filter works:\n   - When given two lists `[]` and `'a'`, where there are zero elements containing the substring 'a', it returns another empty list `[]`. This indicates that no matches were found, so an appropriate response is a clean slate (an empty result).\n   \n4. The function implementation uses Python\u2019s built-in filter functionality combined with a lambda expression to check for each string's presence of the substring: \n   - It iterates over every element in `strings` and applies this condition, effectively filtering out those that do not contain 'substring'. Only strings meeting or exceeding our criteria remain.\n   \n5. Here is how you could implement it following Python best practices for readability (note there's no need to use type hints here since we are already using them in the function definition):\n\n```python\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring.\n    \n    >>> filtered = filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')\n    ['abc', 'bacd', 'array']  # These are the elements containing at least one occurrence of \"a\"\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(filter(lambda s: substring in s, strings))\n```\n\n6. The function is already well-documented with a docstring explaining its purpose and providing examples for users to understand how it should be used effectively (including the expected output). This makes your code more accessible and maintainable by other developers or future you when revisiting this piece of logic again in their projects. \n\n7. The function is concise, efficient as Python's built-in `filter` combined with a lambda expression provides an elegant way to perform such filtering tasks without unnecessary complexity like explicit loops which can be prone to errors and harder on performance for large datasets due to the overhead of iteration in languages that don\u2019t optimize list comprehensions or similar constructs.\n   \n8. The function is ready-to-use, as shown by its inclusion within a docstring with examples (doctests). This encourages others who read your code\u2014or even you yourself when revisiting it later on\u2014to quickly understand and test the functionality without having to write additional tests or run separate scripts for validation.\n   \n9. The function is general-purpose, as there are no hardcoded values within its logic; instead, all necessary information (input list of strings `strings` and substring) must be provided by users when they call it\u2014making the code reusable in various contexts where similar filtering might apply but with different inputs or substrings.\n   \n10. The function is robust against edge cases: if an empty input string (`[]`) were to pass through, as shown in one of its examples and expected outputs within a docstring comment (though not explicitly tested), it would return another clean slate\u2014an empty list `[]`. This behavior aligns with the typical expectations for filtering functions where no matches yield nothing.\n   \n11. The function is self-contained, meaning that all necessary code to perform its task resides within itself without relying on external modules or libraries beyond Python's standard library\u2014which makes it portable and easy to deploy in various environments with minimal setup required (assuming the environment has access to `List` from typing module for type hinting).\n   \n12. The function is concise, as demonstrated by its one-liner implementation using built-in Python functions that are widely recognized among developers familiar with functional programming paradigms in other languages or those who have used similar constructs before (like list comprehensions and the `filter` method), making it an",

It then checks whether or not this particular `substring` is present using Python\u2019s built-in 'in' keyword. If the condition holds true, it includes that specific `string` in its new filtered output; otherwise, it skips to check next string element until all elements have been checked and processed accordingly based on our substring criteria.\n\nRemember this function will return a list of strings containing at least one occurrence (not necessarily full match) of the given 'substring'.

The function returns a new list containing only those elements from `strings` where at least one instance of `substring` can be found in them, using Python's built-in `.contains()` method for string objects (or equivalently with regular expressions). This means that if the substring is present within an element, it will remain; otherwise, any strings without this specific sequence are excluded from our result.\n    - The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each item in `strings`. For every iteration: \n        * It checks whether or not `.contains(substring)` returns True (meaning the substring is found within that string).\n        * If it does, this element gets included into our new filtered result. Otherwise, if False, we skip over and don't include in results list for further iterations of comprehension loop through `strings`. \n    - The function then outputs a cleaned-up version of the input strings with only those that meet these criteria remaining \u2013 essentially acting as an efficient filter mechanism based on substring presence.\n    \nHere is how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nimport re # Import regular expressions module for more complex filtering if needed in future use cases \n\ndef filter_by_substring(strings: List[str], substring: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Filter an input list of strings only for ones that contain given substring.\n    \n    >>> filtered = filter_by_substring(['abc', 'bacd', 'cde'], 'a')\n    ['abc', 'bacd'] # The string \"array\" is not in the original provided example, but here it would be excluded as well if included by mistake. \n    \n    >>> filtered = filter_by_substring(['hello world!', '', None], '')\n    []  \n    \"\"\"\n    return [string for string in strings if substring in string] # List comprehension that filters out elements not containing the specified `substring`\n```\nThis implementation is consistent with your original function and should work as intended. It's also worth mentioning, however, to clarify why we used `.contains()` instead of a regular expression match: Python\u2019s built-in string methods are generally more straightforward for simple substring searches compared to regex which might be overkill unless you need pattern matching capabilities beyond mere presence checks (which could then justify the import and use of `re`).\n\nRemember, when using this function in your codebase or as part of a larger system: \n- Always test with various inputs including edge cases. For example, what happens if there are no strings containing 'a'? Or an empty list is provided without any expected results \u2013 these should be accounted for and handled appropriately (as shown by the examples in your docstring).\n    - The function as written will return `[]` when given a completely empty input because it won\u2019t find anything to filter. This behavior aligns with typical expectations of filtering functions, but if you need different handling here \u2013 like raising an exception or returning some specific value indicating no matches were found (like None) \u2013 that would be something else entirely and should also be documented in the function's docstring for clarity on its contract/interface.\n- The examples provided within your `docstring` are great illustrations of how to use this filter, but remember they only serve as documentation here; actual usage will depend upon context wherein you\u2019re applying these filters (e.g., data cleaning in a larger application). \n    - It's also good practice when writing functions like `filter_by_substring` that the function name and parameters are self-explanatory, as they were here \u2013 but if this was part of more extensive code with many similarly named or purposeful elements (functions/variables), additional context might be necessary for clarity.",

Here's what each part does:\n\n1. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total by iterating through every integer and adding them together using Python\u2019s built-in `sum()` function which returns a sum of all elements in an array or list. If there are no integers (an empty input), it defaults to 0 as per your specification, following standard mathematical conventions where zero is considered the identity element for addition\u2014meaning any number added with zero remains unchanged.\n   \n2. **Product Calculation**: It calculates a product by iterating through each integer and multiplying them together using Python\u2019s built-in `math.prod()` function, which returns the total multiplication of all elements in an array or list (this requires importing math module). If there are no integers present\u2014an empty input again defaults to 1 as per your specification because one is considered a neutral element for multiplication; any number multiplied by one remains unchanged mathematically.\n   \n3. **Return Value**: The function returns these two calculated values in the form of a tuple `(sum, product)`. This makes it easy and convenient when you need to access both summed value or total products separately without having separate variables for each calculation result. It also provides clear documentation through docstrings explaining what is expected as input (a list) and how this function behaves with different inputs like empty lists (`[]`).\n   \n4. **Edge Case Handling**: The provided code already handles edge cases where the given `numbers` list might be empty, returning `(0, 1)` which aligns perfectly with mathematical definitions of summing an empty set (giving zero) and multiplying by one element from a non-existent product group.\n   \n5. **Test Cases**: The docstring also includes example test cases to demonstrate how the function should behave when given different inputs, including both typical use case (`[1, 2, 3, 4]`) and edge case scenarios (empty list `[]`). These examples are useful for anyone trying out or testing this code.\n   \nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function operates:\n\na. The input is checked to see if it\u2019s an empty list, which would trigger default values `(0, 1)`. If not, proceed with calculations as follows:\n   - Initialize `total_sum` and `product`, setting them both initially at zero or one respectively (depending on the edge case).\n   \nb. Iterate through each integer in the input list using a for loop; during this iteration do two things simultaneously\u2014add to your running total sum, while also multiplying into product:\n   - For `total_sum`, use Python\u2019s built-in function that sums up all elements of an iterable (like our numbers). This is efficient and concise.\n   \nc. After the loop finishes executing because there are no more integers to process, return a tuple with these two calculated values `(total_sum, product)`. The result will be in this form: `return total_sum, math.prod(numbers)` where we assume that you have imported necessary modules like 'math' for multiplication of all elements and the built-in sum function is used as well to calculate sums efficiently.\n   \nHere\u2019s how one might implement it with proper imports (if not already present):\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nimport math  # Required if using `prod` from Python's standard library for multiplication of all elements in a list\n\ndef sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n    \"\"\" For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of the sum and product.

The first value in the tuple will be the sum of all the integers in the given list, while the second value will represent their product (multiplication result). Here's what each part does:\n\n1. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total by iterating through every integer and adding them together using Python\u2019s built-in `sum()` function or a manual summation loop if you implement it without calling sum(). The expected behavior is that an empty list should result in a sum of 0, which aligns with how sums are defined mathematically.\n\n2. **Product Calculation**: It calculates the product by iterating through every integer and multiplying them together using Python\u2019s built-in `prod()` function from the math module or manually implementing it if you choose not to use this method (which would require initializing a variable at 1, then updating that value with each multiplication). The expected behavior is that an empty list should result in a product of 1 because multiplying by nothing doesn't change anything.\n\n3. **Return Value**: It returns these two calculated values as a tuple `(sum_result, product_result)`.\n\n4. **Type Annotations and Docstring Explanation**: The function uses type annotations to specify that the input should be `List[int]` (a list of integers) and it will return a value expected to also have integer types\u2014specifically as part of a tuple `(int, int)`.

This means that for every element in the input list (except possibly the first one), we compare it with the previous maximum value, updating our result if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can understand this function step by step:\n\n1. The `rolling_max` function takes a single argument called `numbers`, which is expected to be a List of integers (`List[int]`). This input list represents your sequence where we want to find the rolling maximum values up until each point in time (or index) within that sequence.\n   \n2. Inside this function, there's an empty return statement: `[ ]`. Here you will write code which processes `numbers` and returns a List of integers representing these processed results\u2014specifically, it should be the rolling maximum values up to each point in time for your input list. The expected output is provided as comments above the definition line (`# >>>`).\n   \n3. To implement this function:\n   - Initialize an empty resultant list (let's call it `rolling_maxes`) which will store our computed rolling maximums, starting with just one element `[numbers[0]]` because that is your initial maximum value up to the first index in sequence by default.\n   \n   - Iterate through each number (`num`) of input list except for possibly its very last item (since we don't have a following point at which to compare it). For every `num`, you will check if this current element is greater than your previously stored maximum value: If so, update the rolling maximums with that new higher max.\n   \n   - Append each updated or unchanged running-max into our resultant list (`rolling_maxes`). This way at any given moment in time (index), you will have recorded what was then considered as your highest number up to this point within `numbers`.\n    \nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until each moment in sequence.\n        \n        >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])\n        [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize the result list with first element of input as initial rolling max.\n    rolling_maxes = [numbers[0]] if numbers else []\n    \n    for num in numbers[1:]:\n        current_rolling_max = max(num, rolling_maxes[-1])  # Compare to the last maximum value found so far.\n        \n        # Append new running-maximum into result list; this will be either `current_rolling_max` or unchanged from previous iteration if not exceeded by current number.\n        rolling_maxes.append(current_rolling_max)  \n    \n    return rolling_maxes  # Return the computed rollings maximums up to each point in time for input list of numbers.\n```\nNow, when you call `print(rolling_max([1,2,3,4]))`, it should output `[1,2,3,4]`, which represents maximum values found at every index until that moment within the sequence: 1 (at first element), then max between [1,2], next is still 3 as no higher value has appeared after second position and so on.\n\nThis way you can understand what this function does\u2014and how to implement it in Python code!",

Once the loop finishes, we have a list that represents rolling maximums up until each point in time within our original sequence: `[1, 2, 3]`.

The purpose here seems to be tracking which number has been seen so far at any moment while iterating through the given list, without actually sorting it.\n\nHere's how you can understand and implement this function step by step:\n\n1. **Understand Input**: You are provided with a `List[int]` called 'numbers', representing an ordered sequence of integers where we want to find rolling maxima values up until each point in the list.\n   \n2. **Initialize Variables (if needed)**: In this case, you don't need additional variables because Python lists and their built-in functions can handle it efficiently without extra storage for tracking purposes. However, if we were to implement a similar function from scratch or with different constraints in mind, initializing some variable might be necessary\u2014for example, keeping track of the current maximum value as you iterate through 'numbers'.\n   \n3. **Iterate Through Input List**: Loop over each element `num` within your input list while maintaining an updated max-value seen so far (if needed). In Python's case with built-in functions and methods, this step is simplified since we can use a more straightforward approach without manual iteration or additional variables.\n   \n4. **Update Rolling Maximum**: For each element in the input list, determine if it\u2019s greater than your current rolling maximum (if you were to implement with extra storage). If so, update this value accordingly; otherwise, keep using the existing max-value for that position's output array/list entry.\n   \n5. **Construct Output List**: As we go through each element in 'numbers', append either our current rolling maximum or the new number itself (if it is larger than what was previously recorded as a roll) to an empty list called `rolling_max`. This way, you'll end up with your final output which contains all of these maxima values.\n   \n6. **Return Output List**: Once we have iterated through the entire input 'numbers', return this newly constructed list containing rolling maximum elements at each point in time within our original sequence.\n\nHere is how you can implement it using Python's built-in functions, which makes use of `itertools.accumulate` to efficiently generate a running sum:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nimport itertools\n\ndef rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a given list of integers, generate a list containing the maximum element found until each moment in sequence.\n    \n    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])\n    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]\n    \"\"\"\n    return list(itertools.accumulate(numbers))[:-1] + numbers[-len(numbers):]\n```\nIn this implementation:\n\n* `itertools.accumulate` is used to generate the cumulative maximum of each element in 'numbers'. This means that for every position, it gives you all elements up until and including itself as a rolling sum (which happens naturally with accumulation). Since we want maxima instead of sums here:\n    * We slice this list from start till one less than its length to remove the last value which is not needed. The slicing operation `[:-1]` effectively removes that extra element, and then concatenating it back onto our result using `[len(numbers)]` at the end gives us exactly what we need\u2014a sequence of maximums up until each point in time within 'numbers'.\n    * This approach is efficient because Python's built-in functions are optimized for performance. It also eliminates any explicit loop and additional variable management, making it a clean solution to this problem with minimal code complexity.",

Initialize an empty list called `rolling_maxes` which will store your results (the new sequence with the maximum values).\n2. Set up two variables, one for keeping track of the current max (`current_max`) and another to iterate through each number in the input list along with its index (`index`). The initial value is set as `-float('inf')` so that any integer from `numbers` will be greater than this initially (considering negative infinity).\n3. Loop over every element of your given sequence:\n    a. Compare if current max should change based on the new number encountered in iteration (`if numbers[index] > current_max`). If it is, update `current_max`.\n    b. Append this updated or unchanged maximum value to our results list at each step (this will be done using `.append()` method).\n4. Once all elements have been iterated through and their respective maximums added into the resultant sequence accordingly, return that finalized rolling maxes array as output of your function.\n5.

          "generated_text": "The provided Python function `rolling_max` is designed to take a list of integers as input and return a new list containing the rolling maximum (also known as \"running\" or \"sliding\") elements up until each point in time within the original sequence. The purpose here seems to be tracking which number has been seen so far with its highest value encountered at any given moment while iterating through the array from left to right.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what this function does:\n\n1. It defines an input parameter `numbers`, expecting it as a list containing integers (`List[int]`). This is where you will provide your sequence data for processing.\n2. The return type hint indicates that the output should also be in List format, with each element being of integer type (`-> List[int]`), which means we expect to get back another list after executing this function.\n3. Inside the body of `rolling_max`, it initializes a variable called `current_maximum` and sets its value as negative infinity (using `-float('inf')`). This acts like an \"initial maximum\" that is guaranteed to be lower than any number in our input list, ensuring proper comparison on first encounter.\n4. It then iterates over each element (`num`) of the provided `numbers` using a for loop:\n   - For every new item encountered during this iteration (i.e., at index 'i'), it updates `current_maximum`: if our current number is greater than what we've seen so far, that means there has been an increase in rolling maximum value; hence the update of `current_maximum` to be equal to the new element (`num`).\n   - After each iteration (for every item), it appends this latest calculated 'rolling max', which is stored within a temporary variable called `temp`, into our result list named `result`. This way, we're building up an accumulating sequence of maximum values.\n5. Once the loop finishes processing all elements in input array (`numbers`), and after that moment has been reached for each item (i.e., at every index 'i'), it returns this newly constructed result list containing rolling maximums till then, which is what we've built up during our iterations inside `result`.\n6. Finally there are some test cases provided as docstrings to illustrate how the function works when given a specific input sequence of integers and showing its expected output for that case: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]`. The result should be another list with rolling maximums up until each point in time within this original array.\n7. When you run the function as shown above (using `>>>`), it will return a new sequence of integers representing these maximum values: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]`. This means that at every index 'i', we've gotten our rolling maximums up to and including the current element.\n\nHere is an implementation based on your description without using built-in Python functions:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\ndef rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    result = []  # Initialize our output list to store the results of each step.\n    \n    current_maximum = -float('inf')  \n    for num in numbers:                      \n        if num > current_maximum:            \n            current_maximum = num          \n        \n        result.append(current_maximum)          # Append the latest rolling maximum to our results list after each iteration (for every item). \n    \n    return result  \n```\nThis implementation follows your logic and should produce identical output when given a sequence of integers as input, just like in the original function you provided.",

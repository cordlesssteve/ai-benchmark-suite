# AI Benchmark Suite - Current Status
**Status:** ACTIVE PROJECT
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-27
**Project Phase:** Initial Implementation Complete
**Next Phase:** Testing and Validation

## üìä Current Reality

### ‚úÖ Completed (September 2025)
- **Core Architecture**: Unified framework integrating BigCode and LM-Eval harnesses
- **Git Infrastructure**: Repository initialized with safe read-only submodules
- **Configuration System**: YAML-based model, suite, and harness configurations
- **Unified Runner**: Main orchestration interface with task routing
- **Statistical Analysis**: Migrated from previous projects (template sensitivity, Pass@K)
- **Documentation**: README, safety guidelines, and basic structure
- **Model Interfaces**: Basic Ollama integration, placeholders for HF/API

### üîÑ In Progress
- **Documentation Standardization**: Adding CORE universal documentation structure
- **Interface Completion**: Full model interface implementations needed
- **Testing**: End-to-end validation of unified runner

### ‚è≥ Next Up (Priority Order)
1. **Complete model interfaces** for HuggingFace and API models
2. **Test unified runner** with actual harnesses
3. **Validate submodule setup** process
4. **Results processing** pipeline implementation
5. **Performance optimization** and error handling

## üéØ Success Metrics
- [ ] Can run BigCode evaluation via unified interface
- [ ] Can run LM-Eval evaluation via unified interface
- [ ] Submodules update safely without modification risk
- [ ] Statistical analysis produces meaningful results
- [ ] Setup process works on fresh system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Unified runner needs testing with actual harnesses
- Model interface implementations are incomplete stubs
- Results processing pipeline not yet implemented
- No automated tests or validation

## üóÇÔ∏è Active Planning Documents
- **ACTIVE_PLAN.md**: Current development execution plan
- **ROADMAP.md**: Strategic feature roadmap (3-6 months)
- **FEATURE_BACKLOG.md**: Prioritized enhancement ideas

## üìà Recent Progress
**September 27, 2025:**
- Unified AI Benchmarking Suite architecture implemented
- Safe git submodule configuration with read-only protection
- Complete configuration system with YAML definitions
- Statistical analysis migration from existing projects
- Initial commit with 79 files and full documentation

**Previous Work (September 9, 2025):**
- Individual projects: ai-benchmark-suite and real-code-eval
- Extensive testing with Ollama models (phi3, qwen-coder)
- Statistical analysis development and validation
- Performance comparison reports and methodology

## üîç Key Learnings
- Code duplication between projects was significant waste
- Submodule safety is critical to prevent accidental upstream PRs
- Statistical analysis (template sensitivity, Pass@K) provides real value
- Unified interface dramatically improves usability vs. separate harnesses

**Document Status:** ACTIVE
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-08
**Related Research:** ~/docs/AI_BENCHMARK_CONTAMINATION_RESEARCH_2025.md

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes benchmark contamination risks for the benchmarks used in our AI Benchmark Suite and outlines mitigation strategies based on 2025 research findings.

**Key Finding:** Our current benchmark suite uses HumanEval and custom coding problems, which have **CONFIRMED contamination issues** in the research literature. We need to implement contamination-resistant alternatives and multi-benchmark validation.

---

## Current Benchmark Suite Inventory

### 1. Simple Coding Problems (10 problems)
**Source:** Custom-created by our team
**Contamination Risk:** 🟡 **MODERATE**

**Problems:**
- add_numbers, is_even, fibonacci, factorial, reverse_string, etc.
- Basic algorithmic patterns (common in training data)

**Risk Assessment:**
- These are fundamental programming patterns likely present in training corpora
- However, our *specific test cases* are unique
- Risk: Models may have seen similar problems, not our exact implementations

**Contamination Status:** 🤔 LIKELY present in generic form, ❓ UNKNOWN for specific test cases

### 2. HumanEval Subset (15-20 problems)
**Source:** OpenAI's HumanEval benchmark
**Contamination Risk:** 🔴 **HIGH - CONFIRMED CONTAMINATED**

**Evidence from 2025 Research:**
- Part of "The SWE-Bench Illusion" findings (arXiv 2506.12286v3)
- Public GitHub dataset since 2021
- Widely used in model training papers
- Known to be in training data for major models

**Official HumanEval Status:**
- ✓ VERIFIED: Included in major pre-training corpora
- ✓ VERIFIED: Referenced in 1000+ research papers
- ✓ VERIFIED: Available on HuggingFace, GitHub, multiple mirrors

**Our Usage:**
```python
# Example from our suite
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if any two numbers are closer than threshold """

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Separate nested parentheses into groups """
```

**Contamination Impact:**
- Models likely memorized HumanEval problems during pre-training
- Our results may reflect memorization rather than reasoning ability
- Comparison across models invalid if contamination varies by model

### 3. Domain-Specific Tests (5 domains)
**Source:** Custom-created examples
**Contamination Risk:** 🟡 **MODERATE**

**Domains:**
- Web Development (React JSX, fetch API)
- Data Science (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn workflows)
- Algorithms & Data Structures (binary search, etc.)
- Database/SQL (joins, aggregations)

**Risk Assessment:**
- Common patterns from documentation and tutorials
- Likely present in training data in similar forms
- Our specific test cases may be unique

**Contamination Status:** 🤔 LIKELY generic patterns, ❓ UNKNOWN specific cases

### 4. Adaptive Learning Test
**Source:** Repeated evaluation with learning
**Contamination Risk:** 🟢 **LOW** (methodology, not content)

**Approach:**
- Tests model's ability to adapt over 25-30 iterations
- Uses same problems as other suites (inherits their contamination risk)
- Focus on learning dynamics rather than absolute accuracy

**Risk Assessment:**
- Contamination affects baseline performance, not learning capability
- Still valuable for comparing adaptation rates across models

## 2025 Research Findings Applied to Our Suite

### HumanEval Contamination Evidence

**From "The SWE-Bench Illusion" (June 2025):**
> "SOTA models achieve **76% accuracy on file-path identification** without necessary context. Strong evidence of memorization rather than reasoning."

**From LessLeak-Bench (2025):**
> "Software engineering benchmarks show minimal leakage (4.8% Python), but **HumanEval excluded from analysis** due to known widespread contamination."

**Implication for Our Suite:**
Our HumanEval subset results should be treated as **upper-bound memorization scores**, not true reasoning capability.

### Contamination Types Affecting Our Benchmarks

1. **Pre-training Contamination** 🔴
   - HumanEval: CONFIRMED in major model training sets
   - Simple problems: LIKELY as generic patterns
   - Domain-specific: LIKELY from documentation

2. **Fine-tuning Contamination** 🟡
   - Instruction datasets often include HumanEval
   - Unknown for specific models we test

3. **Search-Time Contamination** 🟢
   - Not applicable (we use local Ollama models)
   - No internet access during evaluation

4. **Memorization vs Understanding** 🔴
   - Critical issue for HumanEval subset
   - Our current testing doesn't distinguish

## Contamination Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions (Can Implement Now)

#### 1. Multi-Template Evaluation
**Based on:** BENCHMARKING_METHODOLOGY.md recommendations

**Implementation:**
```python
# Current (single template)
prompt = f"def {function_name}({args}):\n    "

# Proposed (multi-template)
templates = {
    'direct': lambda p: f"{p.signature}\n    ",
    'instruction': lambda p: f"Complete this function:\n{p.signature}",
    'conversational': lambda p: f"Please implement:\n{p.signature}",
    'docstring_first': lambda p: f'"""{p.docstring}"""\ndef {p.name}({p.args}):'
}

# Run each problem with all templates
for template_name, template_fn in templates.items():
    result = evaluate(model, template_fn(problem))
    results[template_name] = result

# Report sensitivity metrics
report = {
    'best_prompt_score': max(scores),
    'average_score': mean(scores),
    'worst_prompt_score': min(scores),
    'prompt_sensitivity': max(scores) - min(scores)  # NEW METRIC
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces impact of prompt-specific memorization
- Reveals whether models memorized specific formats
- More robust comparison across models

**Implementation Effort:** LOW (2-3 hours)

#### 2. Prompt Sensitivity Reporting
**Add new metrics to all benchmark reports:**

```json
{
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:3b",
  "humaneval_subset": {
    "template_results": {
      "direct": {"accuracy": 0.65, "avg_quality": 0.71},
      "instruction": {"accuracy": 0.58, "avg_quality": 0.68},
      "conversational": {"accuracy": 0.62, "avg_quality": 0.69},
      "docstring_first": {"accuracy": 0.67, "avg_quality": 0.72}
    },
    "sensitivity_metrics": {
      "accuracy_range": 0.09,
      "most_sensitive_problem": "has_close_elements",
      "least_sensitive_problem": "add_numbers"
    }
  }
}
```

**Implementation Effort:** LOW (1-2 hours)

#### 3. Cross-Benchmark Validation
**Add new benchmark sources to test transfer:**

```python
# Current suite
suites = {
    'simple': SimpleCodingProblems(),
    'humaneval': HumanEvalSubset(),  # CONTAMINATED
    'domain': DomainSpecificTests()
}

# Proposed additions
suites = {
    'simple': SimpleCodingProblems(),
    'humaneval': HumanEvalSubset(),  # Keep for baseline
    'humaneval_paraphrased': ParaphrasedHumanEval(),  # NEW - detect memorization
    'mbpp_subset': MBPPSubset(),  # NEW - different public benchmark
    'custom_unique': CustomUniqueProblems(),  # NEW - never published
    'domain': DomainSpecificTests()
}
```

**Paraphrasing Strategy:**
```python
# Original HumanEval problem
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if any two numbers are closer than threshold """

# Paraphrased version (same logic, different naming/description)
def check_proximity(values: List[float], max_distance: float) -> bool:
    """ Determine if any pair of values has distance less than max_distance """
```

**Benefits:**
- Paraphrased versions detect pure memorization
- Performance drop on paraphrased = evidence of contamination
- Custom unique problems provide clean baseline

**Implementation Effort:** MEDIUM (1-2 days for paraphrasing + new problems)

### Medium-Term Actions (1-2 Weeks)

#### 4. Integrate Contamination-Resistant Benchmarks

**Option A: SWE-bench Live Subset**
- Monthly updates with fresh problems
- Post-cutoff for most model training
- More realistic than isolated functions

**Challenges:**
- Requires full repository context (larger input)
- More complex evaluation (not just function completion)
- May need GitHub API integration

**Option B: Custom Temporal Benchmark**
- Create new problems monthly
- Timestamp and version control
- Rotate out after 3 months

**Example Structure:**
```
benchmarks/
├── 2025-10/  # Current month (active)
│   ├── python_problems.json
│   ├── metadata.json  # Creation date, difficulty, tags
│   └── solutions/
├── 2025-09/  # Archived but available
├── 2025-08/  # Archived
└── README.md  # Benchmark lifecycle policy
```

**Implementation Effort:** MEDIUM (initial setup: 1 week, ongoing: 4 hours/month)

#### 5. Semantic Code Evaluation
**Move beyond exact string matching:**

```python
# Current evaluation (string matching)
def evaluate_simple(output: str, expected: str) -> bool:
    return expected in output

# Proposed (semantic evaluation)
def evaluate_semantic(output: str, test_cases: List[TestCase]) -> float:
    """
    Execute generated code against test cases.
    Returns quality score 0.0-1.0 based on:
    - Correctness (test pass rate)
    - Code quality (complexity, readability)
    - Edge case handling
    """
    score = 0.0

    # Parse and execute code
    try:
        exec_result = safe_execute(output, test_cases)
        score += exec_result.pass_rate * 0.7  # 70% weight on correctness
        score += exec_result.quality_metrics * 0.3  # 30% weight on quality
    except SyntaxError:
        score = 0.0

    return score
```

**Benefits:**
- Rewards correct behavior over memorized syntax
- Harder to game through memorization
- More robust to paraphrasing

**Implementation Effort:** MEDIUM (3-5 days with safety considerations)

### Long-Term Actions (1-3 Months)

#### 6. Private Hold-out Test Set
**Inspired by ARC-AGI methodology:**

**Structure:**
```
benchmarks/
├── public/  # Available for development/tuning
│   ├── training_set.json  (400 problems)
│   └── validation_set.json  (100 problems)
└── private/  # NEVER committed to git
    └── test_set.json  (100 problems)
```

**Private Set Protocol:**
- Stored only on secure evaluation server
- Never shared in papers, repos, or discussions
- Rotated every 6 months
- Results published without problem details

**Implementation Effort:** HIGH (requires secure infrastructure)

#### 7. Continuous Benchmark Evolution
**Living benchmark approach:**

```python
# Benchmark versioning
{
  "benchmark_version": "2025.10.1",
  "creation_date": "2025-10-08",
  "retirement_date": "2026-01-08",  # 3 months lifespan
  "problems": [...],
  "contamination_status": "CLEAN",  # Updated based on detection
  "known_model_cutoffs": {
    "gpt-4-turbo": "2023-12",  # Before this benchmark
    "claude-3-opus": "2023-08",  # Before this benchmark
    "qwen2.5-coder": "2024-09"  # After this benchmark
  }
}
```

**Automation:**
- Monthly new problem generation
- Quarterly benchmark rotation
- Automatic contamination detection (search for problems online)

**Implementation Effort:** HIGH (requires tooling + ongoing maintenance)

## Transparency & Reporting Guidelines

### For Research Papers/Reports
**REQUIRED Disclosures:**

```markdown
## Benchmark Contamination Disclosure

**HumanEval Subset:**
This benchmark uses 15-20 problems from OpenAI's HumanEval dataset, which is
confirmed to be present in the training data of major language models (see
"The SWE-Bench Illusion", arXiv 2506.12286v3, 2025). Results on this benchmark
may reflect memorization rather than reasoning capability.

**Contamination Mitigation:**
- Multi-template evaluation (4 prompt formats) to detect format-specific memorization
- Prompt sensitivity metrics reported (accuracy range: X.XX)
- Cross-validation with paraphrased versions to detect pure memorization
- Custom unique problems as clean baseline

**Result Interpretation:**
HumanEval results should be treated as upper-bound performance estimates.
For accurate capability assessment, refer to custom unique problem results
and temporal benchmark scores.
```

### For Internal Reports
**Contamination Status Badge:**

```
🔴 CONTAMINATION WARNING: HumanEval benchmark
   - Known contamination in major model training sets
